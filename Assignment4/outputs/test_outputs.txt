You know that what I do is write for kids, and in fact, I'm probably the author for kids, read in the United States.
And I always tell the people that I don't want to seem like a scientist.
I can <unk> it as farmer, or with leather leather and no one has ever chosen a farmer.
I'm here to talk to you about circles and <unk>
And you know that a concern, usually something that fell somewhere else.
You just have to go back to the apple to see it as a <unk>
That's the paint of a circle.
A friend of mine did that -- Richard <unk>
It's the kind of circle which I'm going to talk to you.
My circle started in the middle years in the middle school, in <unk> Ohio where I was the rare of the classroom.
When I went down to her every week in the bathroom, until a teacher saved my life.
She saved my life when I was allowed to go into the bathroom room.
I did it in secret.
for three years.
And I had to go from the city.
He had a thumb, and 85 dollars, and I ended up in San Francisco, California -- I found a lover -- and in the 1950s.
About three or four years ago, half the night I got a phone call from that masterpiece, the lady <unk> who said, "I need to see you.
I'm <unk> that of adults never get to know us.
You could put it into Ohio and please bring that man that I know you've heard before.
And I have to tell you that I have <unk> <unk> and I would like you to love this please."
Well, the next day we were in <unk>
We went to see, we were <unk> and we realized that she needed to be <unk>
We found a place, the <unk> and the <unk> and the <unk> of his family, because it was necessary, because it was necessary, because it was necessary, for it.
It's something we knew how to do.
And as the woman who wanted to <unk> as an adult came to <unk> became a box of ashes and put in my hands.
And what happened was that the circle was closed, had turned into a circle -- and that epiphany that I talked about was done in itself.
<unk> is that death is part of life.
She saved my life, my partner and I saved her.
And you know that that part of life needs everything that the rest of life.
It needs truth and beauty and I'm very happy that today I was talking about this.
It also needs -- needs dignity, love and pleasure. And it's our job to provide those things.
Thank you.
As artist, the connection is very important for me.
Through my work, I'm trying to express that humans are not separated from nature and everything is interconnected.
I went to Antarctica about 10 years ago, and I saw my first <unk>
I was <unk>
My heart can quickly, was <unk> trying to understand what was in front of me.
The <unk> on my way around the water -- almost 60 meters -- and I could not be able to think that it was a <unk> about another <unk> of snow after year.
The <unk> are born when they fall from the glaciers or the <unk>
Each iceberg has its own individual personality.
They have a different way of interacting with their environment and their experiences.
Some people refuse to give up and hold up to the end, while others can't get more and more <unk> in a <unk> <unk>
It's easy to think, when you see a <unk> that are isolated and separated and themselves, in large measure as we see we sometimes as humans.
But reality is all the opposite.
As a melts melts in a <unk> I'm breathing its atmosphere.
As a eardrum melts a iceberg released fresh water in minerals that feed many forms of life.
I come up to photograph these <unk> as if it would be the portraits of my ancestors, knowing that in these only there are only the way that they are not going to come back to exist again.
It's not the death when it's <unk> it's not an end, but a continuation of its way through the cycle of life.
Part of the ice in the <unk> which photograph is very <unk> has a couple of thousands of years.
And another part of the ice has over 100 thousand years.
The last few pictures I would like to show you are from a eardrum I photographed in <unk> Greenland.
It's kind of often really often going to witness a <unk>
Here you have it.
You can see the left a little boat.
It's about five feet.
And I'd like to pay attention to the form of iceberg and your line of <unk>
You can see here, it begins to <unk> the boat has moved toward the other side and the man is standing there.
This is an <unk> iceberg from average size.
<unk> of water about 120 feet or 40 feet.
This video is in real time.
And so <unk> the eardrum shows a different side of his personality.
Thank you.
I want you to imagine two couples in 1979, the same day, exactly at the same time, every single <unk> Okay.
So two couples every one with a baby.
I don't want it to be <unk> too much of the details of conception, because if they stop thinking about the conception of yes, I'm not going to pay attention.
Let's think about that for a moment.
And on this scenario I want you to imagine that, in a case, the chromosome and the sperm goes together to the X chromosome <unk>
And in the other case, the X chromosome goes together.
They both <unk> and the life.
We'll talk about them later.
In my ground floor to get two roles.
In one of my <unk> work with the history of anatomy.
I'm a <unk> for training, and what I study in this case is the way people are trying to experience the anatomy -- that -- of human bodies and <unk> how they have thought about the body, the idea of <unk> what have that thought about the bodies.
The other role that performance in my job is an <unk> of patients, or like I say sometimes, <unk> <unk> of people who are medical patients.
In this case, I've worked with people whose physical features are challenging social norms.
I've been working on, for example, with fraternal twins -- two people inside a same body.
I've worked with people with <unk> people much higher than the average average.
And I've been working with many cases of people with <unk> sex, individuals whose physics strands didn't fit into the male male schemes and conventional women.
At all, we can <unk> <unk>
<unk> takes a lot of ways.
I'm going to give you some examples of ways of having a sex that is not <unk> in the common form or female.
For example, the case is the case of the individual <unk> <unk> whose <unk> gene -- and it tells the <unk> that we all have in life <unk> that become <unk>
And then, in life, the testes produce testosterone.
But because this individual lacks testosterone, body doesn't react to itself.
It's <unk> syndrome.
So there are high levels of testosterone but no reaction.
As a result, the body develops in a typical course of a second.
When you take the baby it looks like a little girl.
It's a little girl. It's raised as a girl.
And often it's not until puberty, when it's growing and developing the breast but it doesn't have the menstrual period, when someone realizes that something is happening.
And then of doing tests you realize that instead of having <unk> and <unk> actually has <unk> and <unk>
The important thing to understand is that you can think it's a man, but it's not really that way.
Women, like men, we have in the body something called <unk>
They're in the back of the body.
The <unk> glands produce <unk> the <unk> hormone.
Most of the women like me -- I consider a woman who is not known for his <unk> structure, I think it's a typical woman of women as I am sensitive to <unk>
We produce <unk> and we respond to the <unk>
As a result, someone like me have the most exposed brain to the <unk> than the woman who was born with <unk> that has the <unk> syndrome.
So sex is something complicated. It's not that <unk> are in the middle of the <unk> in some form can be everywhere.
Another example: a few years ago I got a call from a 19-year-old who was born and raised like <unk> he had a life as a kid and had just figured out that he had <unk> and <unk>
It had an extreme form of a disease known as <unk> <unk> <unk>
He had 20th chromosomes and in the uterus -- the <unk> glands were so active -- that essentially created a male environment.
As a result, their genitals were <unk> his brain was exposed to the hormonal component typically male.
He was born with <unk> no one <unk> anything.
And it was at the age of 19, when he started having doctors caused by the internal <unk> when the doctors discovered that, in fact, a woman in the inside.
Well, another quick example of a <unk> case.
Some people with the 20th chromosomes develop what is known as <unk> is to say, they have <unk> tissue.
We don't know good why that happens.
So there are many varieties of sex.
The reason that children with these kinds of bodies are going to be <unk> fraternal twins or <unk> <unk> surgeries is not to be able to have a better physical health.
In many cases people are perfectly healthy.
The reason why it was <unk> several surgeries is that they're a threat for our social categories.
The system is usually based on the idea that a particular anatomy has <unk> a particular identity.
We have the idea that being a woman is having <unk> identity, <unk> being black.
A terribly simplistic.
And when it presents us a body that shows something quite different, we have problems with <unk>
So we have very <unk> ideas in our culture about the <unk>
Our nation is based on a concept of the very romantic <unk>
Imagine the amazing thing that is having kids who are born like two people inside a same body.
The most high case is last year in the last year with the <unk> <unk> <unk> was put in the fabric of the <unk> <unk>
A lot of reporters called it to ask, "What test are you going to do to determine if you ask <unk> is a man or <unk>
And I had to explain to the reporters that there is no such one.
In fact, we now know that sex is so complicated that we have to admit that nature is not traces a <unk> line between men and women or women, and women and women, we are us who map that line.
So what we have is a situation where the more we go through the question, the more we have to admit that these categories -- we thought were categories that were kind of stable categories.
And not only in terms of sex.
Also in terms of race, something which is much more complicated than the terminology <unk>
As we see, we go into a <unk> terrain.
<unk> for example, the fact that we share at least 95 percent of the DNA with chimpanzees.
How about <unk> of them in just a few <unk>
And as we look at science in science and more and more in a comfortable area where we have to recognize that the categories of <unk> that are probably too <unk>
And we're looking at this in all walks of human life.
One of them, for example, in our culture today, in the United States today, are the struggles in the beginning and in order of life.
It's hard to set a moment from which a body becomes human and has different rights to the <unk>
There are very <unk> discussions today, not in public, but I know within <unk> respect to when someone is being dead.
Our ancestors never had to do it with this question of whether someone was dead.
As long as you got a pen in front of the nose and if he was moving still not <unk>
If I stopped moving it out of moving it.
But today, for example, extract vital organs of a body and put them on another body.
And as a result, we have to deal with the prisoner's of determine really death, and this puts us in a hard situation where we don't have the simple categories of the past.
And you may think that this explosion of categories could be happy to someone like me.
In politics I'm a <unk> <unk> people with unusual bodies, but I have to admit that I got nervous.
So let's think these categories are much more fragile than we thought about me.
<unk> from the concept of democracy.
And to tell you about this tension -- I have to admit that I am a fervent <unk> of the architects.
I know they were <unk> I know they were <unk> but they were big.
I mean, they were so brave and audacious and so <unk> in what they did, that I find every little bit of looking at that music <unk> <unk> and not by the music, which is totally <unk>
It's because of what happened in <unk> with the parents.
Best <unk> were to me, the first activists of the anatomy and tell them why.
What they <unk> was a <unk> concept.
And as you all remember -- what we're going to do with our twin <unk> was the idea of <unk> <unk> was based on a very simplistic concept of anatomy.
The old world didn't know the DNA, but they had clear the idea of the birth of birth.
They had the concept of blue blood.
They were from the idea that the political power was going to be able to be able to be able to go through the Internet of blood passed from the grandfather and the father and so on.
Best <unk> rejected that idea and replaced it for a new concept, and that concept was that all men are created the same.
They <unk> the field of play, and they decided that the anatomy that mattered was the anatomy in common and not <unk> differences, that was something very radical.
And in part they were doing it because they were part of a <unk> system where they were <unk> two things.
It was <unk> democracy and at the same time <unk> science.
And it remains very clear, if you look at the history of the gay, I would find that many people were very interested in science and the idea of a <unk> world.
They were <unk> from the <unk> explanation and thereby <unk> the concept of being able to be transmitted by a kind of <unk> of birth.
They were moving toward a <unk> concept.
And if you look at it, for example, the Declaration of Cairo talk about nature and god of nature.
They don't talk about God and the nature of God.
They talk about the power of nature to tell us who we are.
And the consequence of us were broadcasting the idea of <unk>
And in doing so, they were <unk> the foundations of the future <unk> movement.
They didn't think of that way, but they did it for us, and it was great.
And what happened a few years later?
And the women.
Then the success came from the Civil Rights movement with people from the <unk> <unk> who said, "I'm not a <unk>
We found men in the Civil Rights movement.
And again, people of color that we have been <unk> to <unk> and again, <unk>
We see the same thing with the Slow <unk>
The problem is, of course, that as we look at the <unk> we have to begin to ask, why do we hold certain <unk>
But anyway, I want to keep some <unk> <unk> in our culture.
For example: I don't want to give you a fish the same rights as a human.
I don't want to say that we should be <unk> to anatomy.
I don't want to say that at the age of five years, they were allowed to have to have sex or getting married.
There are some <unk> <unk> that for me to make sense and that I think we should hold on.
But the challenge is to try to find out what they are, why they are, and if they make sense.
Well, let's go back to those two <unk> <unk> at the beginning of this talk.
We have two <unk> both <unk> in the <unk> exactly the same day.
Imagine that one of them, <unk> was born three months before I time: June 1 of 1980.
Henry, on the contrary, born in term: was born on June 1 was born.
For the only fact that I was born three months before Mary got to attribute all the rights three months before President -- the right to sexual consent -- the right to <unk> the right to <unk>
Henry has to wait for all that not because it has a new biological age, but because he was born later.
We found other <unk> in relation to their rights.
Henry, at virtue of being a man -- if I haven't told you whether it's <unk> in virtue of being a man now is <unk> from the gay <unk> that Mary doesn't have to worry about.
<unk> on his part, doesn't have the same rights by marriage that Henry in all states, for example.
Henry can marry every states with a woman, but Mary can marry a woman just in some states.
So still <unk> categories of <unk> that in several aspects are <unk> and questionable.
And now the question is, what do we do now that science moved so much in the field of the anatomy that we get to the point of having to admit that a democracy based on the anatomy could be <unk>
I don't want to give up the science, but at the same time sometimes I feel like science <unk>
Where are we <unk>
It looks like what happens in our culture is a kind of <unk> attitude -- "Well, we have to draw the line somewhere, so we're going to do it.
But a lot of people got caught in a bizarre position.
For example: Texas, in some point has decided that to marry a man don't have to have chromosome. And that to marry a woman has to have the Y.
Now, in practice they don't do cooking tests to people.
But this is also very rare -- given the story that I told you at the beginning of the <unk> syndrome.
If you look at one of the founding fathers of modern democracy, Dr. Martin Luther King, in his speech. "I would love to <unk> it provides a solution.
It says we should judge people <unk> not in the color of their skin, but in the contents of their <unk> going beyond anatomy.
And I want to say, "Yes, the idea looks very good.
But in practice, how do you do that?
How do you judge people based on their <unk>
I want to point out also that I'm not sure that we should be able to take care of this to help people, because I've to admit that I know from some <unk> <unk> who probably deserve more social services than some humans I know.
I also want to say that maybe some of the ones that I know can make you more decisions and intelligent decisions about their sexual relationships than people from 40 that I know.
So how do you put in practice the subject of <unk> content.
It turns out to be very hard.
And one part of me asks what would happen if the character of a person could be measured with an instrument, maybe with an MRI <unk>
We want to really get to that point?
I'm not sure where we go.
What I know is that it seems to be very important that the United States is still going to lead this current thinking of thinking about democracy.
We have done a good job in defense of democracy and I think we're going to make a good job in the future.
We don't live for example, in a context like the Iranian where a man who feels attracted to other men is <unk> to be killed unless he's willing to listen to a change of sex, in which case it is allowed to live.
We're not in that situation.
I'm glad to say that we don't have a context like the one surgeon who was talking about a couple of years ago that I had made up to light fraternal twins to then separate them up, and so on.
But when the phone was asked by the operation of the operation -- he was a very <unk> operation, he said that in that other country, these kids would be very <unk> and so he had to.
What I said, "Well, it's considered political asylum instead of separation <unk>
America offers enormous possibilities to people to be who are without <unk> to change the sake of the state.
So I think we have to be on the head.
Well, to end up, I want to say that I've been talking about <unk>
And I want to think about what democracy would be, or as it might have been, if we were given more involvement to the <unk>
And I want to say something a little bit <unk> for a feminist, and it is that I think there may be different ideas from different <unk> <unk> particularly if there are people thinking about groups.
Since years ago, since I've been interested in <unk> I've also been interested in <unk> I've also been interested in the sexual difference.
And one of the things that has interested me are differences between men and women in the way to think and operate in the world.
And what we know from <unk> studies is that women, on average, -- not all, but in <unk> they tend to pay more attention to complex social relationships and care about those who are <unk> within the group.
And if we think about that, we have an interesting situation in our hands.
A few years ago, when I was in college, one of my advisers who knew that I was interested in feminism -- I was interested in feminism -- I made a <unk>
<unk> what has the female <unk>
And I thought, "This is the <unk> question.
Feminism is to have to get rid of the stereotypes of gender, so there's no female in the <unk>
But the more I thought about his question, more to me that there is something <unk>
I mean, there might be something, on average, something different between the female brain, and the male that makes us more <unk> to complex social and willing to help the most vulnerable.
So if you guys were thrilled to find the way to protect the people for the state of the state, it is possible that they would have gotten more <unk> to this concept, maybe we would have enriched the concept of protecting <unk>
And maybe that's what we have to do in the future when you make democracy beyond <unk> to think less in the individual body, in terms of identity, and think more about relationships.
So while we try to create a more perfect union and we try to create the one for each other.
Thank you.
In 2007, I decided we had to rethink how we think about economic development.
Our new goal should be that when every family thinks where they want to go to live and work, have the possibility of choosing at least a handful of different cities that are competing to attract new residents.
Well, at this point, we're far from that goal.
There are billions of people in developing countries that don't have a single city willing to <unk>
But the amazing thing about cities is that they're worth much more than their building cost.
So we could easily bring it into the world -- maybe hundreds of new cities.
Well, this may sound absurd if you've never thought about new cities.
But just <unk> by buildings for apartments.
Imagine that half of those who wanted to live in apartments already were the owners and the other half is still not <unk>
They might try to increase the capacity by doing <unk> in all existing buildings alone.
But you know that the problem that <unk> is that those buildings and areas that are all around the things that are the standards to avoid the <unk> and the crafting of the construction.
So it would be very hard to do all those <unk>
But they could go to a completely new place, building a whole new apartment building, always and when the norms of that place will be able to make <unk>
So I proposed that governments are going to bring new problems of reform areas to contain cities and gave them a <unk> cities under <unk>
I later learned that more or less at the same time, <unk> and <unk> were thinking about the challenge of 2011.
Did you know that every year about 75,000 <unk> <unk> from his country to go to the United States, and they wanted to ask what they could do to make sure that those people could stay and do those same things in Honduras.
In the summer of 2009 -- I went through a constitutional crisis.
In the next <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> with a platform where they <unk> reforms and at the same time reconciliation.
He asked <unk> who were his boss of <unk>
Meanwhile, I was preparing to give a TEDTalk in TEDGlobal.
Through a process of <unk> trial and error.
The first point was the importance of rules, like those norms that say that you can't go and annoy all the current residents of apartments.
We have a lot of attention to new technologies, but it takes so much of technologies as a norms to <unk> and usually are the rules that prevent us forward.
In the fall of 2010, a friend of Guatemala sent to <unk> a link with <unk>
I showed it to <unk>
They call me.
They said, <unk> this to the leaders of our <unk>
So in December we met in Miami, a hotel hotel room.
I tried to explain this point about valuable how valuable cities are, much more valuable than their cost.
And I used this picture that shows the value of land in a place like New York <unk> which in some cases, are worth thousands of dollars per square meter.
But it was a pretty abstract discussion, and at some point, when there was a pause, <unk> he said, <unk> maybe we could see the video of <unk> talk.
And the talk was described in terms of very simple terms that a city under <unk> is a place where you start with <unk> <unk> a <unk> which is <unk> and a choice for people to be able to go or not live under those norms.
So the president of <unk> was called me and told me that we had to do this project, this is important, this might be the way that our country <unk>
He asked me to go to <unk> and I would talk about four and five of January.
So I presented another talk full of data, which included a picture like this, which was about explaining that to make a lot of value to a city, this has to be very big.
This is a picture of <unk> and the white line is the new airport that was built in <unk>
Just this airport covers over 100 square miles.
So I was trying to convince the <unk> that to build a new city, you have to start with a site that is about one thousand square miles.
That's more than 100,000 acres.
Everyone <unk> <unk>
The audience faces were very serious and <unk>
The Congress leader came up to the platform and said, "Professor <unk> thank you very much for his talk, but maybe we could see the video of the talk.
I have this in my <unk>
So I sat down and showed the <unk>
And this explained <unk> that a new city can offer new choices for the people.
There would be a choice of a city that you could go to go in <unk> rather than hundreds of miles north.
And it also <unk> new choices for leaders.
Because the leaders of the government of <unk> would need help of <unk> countries, they could benefit from the countries associated with them to help them establish and make the standards of <unk> so that everybody could trust that <unk> effectively <unk>
We went and we saw a site.
This picture is there.
It could easily take a thousand square miles.
And a little later, on January of January, voted in Congress to <unk> their Constitution and add a constitutional arrangement that would allow us to create these special regions of development.
In a country that had just passed through this <unk> crisis in Congress for this <unk> <unk> of this constitutional <unk>
All the <unk> all the <unk> in society, <unk>
In order for <unk> it has to pass twice in Congress.
February 17 was passed over again in another voting of <unk> to one.
Immediately after the vote of 21 to 24 of February, an shifting of about 30 <unk> went to the two places in the world that are more interested in participating in building cities.
One of them is South Korea.
This is a picture of a new center of the city that is building in Korea -- is larger than the center of Boston.
Everything you see there was built in four years, after that was four years old, getting the <unk>
The other interested in building cities is Singapore.
In fact, they've built two cities in China, and they're preparing for a third.
And if you think about this for practical, this is the point where we are.
They have a website, and they're thinking about a site for the second city.
They are preparing a legal system that would allow the managers to be able to run under a direct legal system.
A country has committed to allow her Supreme Court to be the final court for this new <unk> system.
There are urban and builders, cities that are very interested in the project.
They can even get some funding.
But the only thing we know that they've figured out is that they have a good number of people.
There are a lot of companies who wanted to be in <unk> especially in a place with an area of free trade, and there's a lot of people who would like to go to live there.
In the world there are 700 million people who say they would like to change immediately another place.
There's a million dollars a year out of Latin America to go to the United States.
A lot of them are parents who have to leave their family to go to get a job, sometimes they have bright moms who have to earn money for just eating or buying clothing.
Unfortunately, sometimes even the kids who are trying to meet with their parents who haven't seen in some cases, in a decade.
So what do you think about building a new city in <unk>
Or build a dozen these, or a hundred all around the world?
What does it look like to emphasize that families can choose between many cities that are competing to attract new <unk>
This is an idea worth spreading.
And my friends <unk> were asked to say, "Thank you TED <unk>
I'm <unk> and this is my <unk>
But before I show you what you're inside, I'm going to make a public confession -- and it's that, I live obsessed with <unk>
I love to find, and most recently, photograph and publish and publish my blog, and colorful <unk> and different for every time.
But I don't buy anything new.
All my clothes is from second of the <unk> markets.
Oh, thank you.
The second hand stores allow me to reduce the impact of my <unk> in the environment and my <unk>
I'm going to meet people -- I know how often my money goes to a good <unk> -- my aspect is <unk> and buying it becomes my personal quest for <unk>
I mean, what am I going to find today?
My size?
I'm going to love the color.
cost less than 20 dollars?
If all the answers are positive, then I feel that I've won.
To go back to the theme of my <unk> I want to tell you what we're going to do for this exciting week at TED.
I mean, what brings someone who has all that <unk>
So I'm going to show you exactly what I suit.
I've brought it seven pairs of interior, and nothing else.
<unk> in exactly a week is all I've put in my <unk>
I thought that would be able to find everything else that I would like to wear after I got here to <unk>
And because you don't know me as the woman who walks for TED in an interior, and that means that I found some things.
And I'd like to show you the sets for this week.
It doesn't sound interesting?
As I do, I'm also going to tell you some of the lessons of life that believe it or not, I've learned in this adventure of not using new clothing.
Start with Sunday.
I call this a brilliant tiger man.
You don't have to spend a lot of money to look good.
You know, almost always you can be made phenomenal for less than 50 dollars.
All the together, including <unk> was <unk> and it's the most expensive thing that I have used in the week.
<unk> the color is power.
It's almost <unk> impossible to be <unk> when you're wearing a bright red <unk>
If you're happy, you're going to attract other happy people.
<unk> <unk>
I've spent a lot of time in life trying to be myself and at the same time <unk>
I just know yourself.
If you get rid of the right people, you don't just give you <unk>
<unk> <unk> of the kid who you're in.
People say to me that it seems to play the <unk> or that I remember their little seven years old.
I like to <unk> and say, <unk>
<unk> trust is the key thing.
If you think you look at something, it's almost certain you are.
And if you think you don't look good at something, it's probably true.
My mother taught me this day after day.
But it wasn't until the 30 years that I really understood their meaning.
And I'm going to explain it in a few seconds.
If you think you're a beautiful person in your inside and outside, there's no look at <unk>
So there's no excuse for one of this audience.
We have to be able to achieve everything we want to achieve.
Thank you.
<unk> A universal universal -- six words for you: <unk> <unk> go.
And finally, <unk> <unk> a personal style, and only is a great way to tell the world something about you without having to say a word.
I've tried over and over again, and again, when people came up to me this week just because of what I was using.
Obviously this is not going to get into my little <unk>
So before I went to home, to Brooklyn, I'm going to give it all.
Because the lesson I'm trying to learn this week is that we have to leave certain things.
I don't need to <unk> these things, because at the back of the corner, there will always be another <unk> and <unk> and bright and <unk> if there's a little bit of love in my heart and after.
Thank you very much.
Thank you.
This is a rendering of your brain that we can split up in two parts.
The left-hand side, which is the <unk> and the right side, which is the part intuitive.
So if you take a scale to measure the <unk> of every <unk> we could design a blueprint for our brain.
For example, this would be somebody who is completely logic.
This would be somebody who is totally intuitive.
So where do you look at your brain at this scale?
Some <unk> for one of these extremes, but I think for most of the members of this audience, their brain is something that -- with a big <unk> in both <unk> at the same time.
It's not to be mutually <unk>
You can sense and intuitive.
And I consider myself one of those people, who just like most of the other quantum physicists -- <unk> we need a lot of logic to <unk> these complicated ideas.
But at the same time, we need a lot of intuition to make the experiments really work.
How do we develop this <unk> Well, we like to play with things.
We're going to play with them and play with them and then we look at the <unk> and then we developed our intuition from that point.
And actually, you do the same.
As intuition as you may have developed over the age of years, is that one thing that says that one thing can be just in a place at the time.
I mean, it might sound weird to think that one thing is in two different places, at the same time, but you weren't born with this <unk> <unk>
I remember looking at a kid playing on a parking bar.
It was a small child, and he didn't do it very well, it was always <unk>
But I bet that playing with that bar with that bar that he taught a compelling lesson, and it's that big things don't allow the <unk> and that stay in a place.
This is a big model model that you can have in the world, except you are a particle particle physicist.
It would be a terrible model for a particle physicist because they don't play with video bars playing with these little little particles.
And when they play with your particles discover that they do all kinds of really rare things -- like they can go through walls, or they can be in two different places at the same time.
And then they wrote all these observations, and they called it the theory of quantum mechanics.
At that point was the physics of a few years ago, you needed quantum mechanics to describe those little particles.
But you didn't need it to describe the big objects around us every day.
That didn't fit very well to my intuition, and maybe it's because they don't play very often with particles.
Well, sometimes play with them, but not very much.
And I've never seen them.
I mean, no one saw a <unk>
But it didn't fit right to my exact part.
Because if everything is made of little particles and all the little particles follow the principles of quantum mechanics, then I shouldn't keep the principles of <unk>
I don't find the reason why it didn't have been.
And therefore I would feel much better if I could actually demonstrate that a common object also follows the principles of quantum mechanics.
That's why some years ago, I proposed to do exactly that.
And I did.
This is the first object that you can see that has been on an overlap of quantum mechanics.
What we see here is a little computer chip.
And you can try to see the green dot in the middle.
That's the little bit of metal I'm going to talk about in a minute.
This is a picture of the object.
And here I'm going to make it a little bit. It's just at the center.
And then here we make a very big approach to the little <unk> of metal.
So what we see is a little bit of metal, with a way of springboard and <unk> in a platform.
And then I did this almost the same way that you would do a computer chip.
I went to a clean room with a new silicon chip and I put all the great machines around about 100 hours.
For the last material, I had to build my own machine -- to make this hole <unk> a swimming <unk> that looks under the device.
This device has the capacity to be on a quantum rate, but for it it needs a little help.
Let me make an analogy.
You know how awkward it is in an elevator full of people.
I mean, when I am on an elevator I do all kinds of weird, but then when other people go up to do those things, because I don't want them to <unk> or, actually, <unk>
Quantum mechanics says that inanimate objects behave in the same way.
The companions in the journey of inanimate objects are not just people, it's also the light that <unk> and the wind that goes on the side and heat from the room.
So we knew that if we wanted this little piece of metal to stop quantum mechanics, we would have to squeeze all the other passengers.
And that was what we did.
<unk> the lights and then <unk> a <unk> and pulled out all the air, and then you put it on a temperature of less than a degree above absolute zero.
Now, when I was just in the <unk> the little piece of metal is free of acting like it.
So we measure their movements.
We discovered that moving in very strange ways.
Instead of staying perfectly still, and it was to vibrating. and the way that I <unk> was like a breath in this way -- like a <unk> that expands and <unk>
And when I gave it a soft thrust, we were able to make it happen, and that I didn't take it at the same time -- something that only happens with quantum mechanics.
So what I'm telling you is something really fantastic.
What does it mean for a <unk> thing, and not <unk> at the same time?
Let's think about atoms.
In one case, every trillions of atoms that make up that piece of metal are still still and at the same time, those same atoms are moving up to the top and down.
It's just in certain <unk> when those are <unk>
In the rest of the time they're <unk>
It means that every atom is in two different places, at the same time, which means that the whole piece of metal is in two different places.
I think this is great.
Seriously.
<unk> <unk> in a clean room to do this for all those years, because, look at this, the difference on scale between one atom.
So if one atom can only be in two different places, at the same time, and that piece of metal can be in two different places, why not you do it?
I mean, it's my kind of logic.
So imagine if you were in several places at the same time, how would that be that?
How about your consciousness if your body is <unk> in space?
There's another part of the story.
And it's when we went on, and we turned the lights and look at the box, we saw that the metal was still there in one piece.
And I could get to this new intuition, and apparently all the objects in the elevator actually are only quantum objects that are just <unk> in a small space.
You hear a lot about that quantum mechanics claims that everything is interconnected.
Well, that's not so true.
It is more profound than that.
So those connections, your connections to all the things that are around you, literally define who you are, and that's the deep queerness of quantum mechanics.
Thank you.
My name is <unk>
And 18 months ago I was doing another work on Google, until I launched the idea of doing something to museums and art to my boss that was here and that enabled me to do that.
It took me 18 months and 18 months old.
A lot of negotiations and stories were <unk> with 17 very interesting museums at nine countries.
But I'm going to focus on <unk>
There's a lot of stories of why we did.
I think my own story is explaining just on this slide, and this is the access.
I grew up in India.
<unk> of a great education -- I didn't get to <unk> but I didn't have access to many of these museums and works of art.
So when I started traveling and go to the museums, I started learning a lot.
And working on Google, I try to make the desire to make it more accessible through technology.
So we formed a team, a great team of people, and we started doing it.
So better that shows the demo to then explain a couple of interesting things that we have done from their launch.
So, let's go to <unk>
Look at all the museums there.
There's the gallery -- the MoMA, the MoMA, the <unk> the <unk> <unk>
I'm actually going to get into one of my favorite <unk> the museum in New York.
There are two ways of doing it -- very easy.
We click and <unk> we're already inside the museum.
It doesn't matter where they are, <unk> or <unk> that doesn't really matter.
You move out there and get <unk>
Would you want to navigate the <unk>
We open the plane, and with one click, we jumped in.
They are inside, you want to go at the end of the hallway in the end.
Are you going to follow it forward.
<unk>
Thank you, but I haven't come to the best.
Now I'm in front of one of my favorite paintings, "The <unk> in Pieter <unk> in the <unk>
I see the <unk>
If the museum shows you the picture, we click there.
Look, this is one of the images.
Here's all the information <unk>
For those of you who are really interested in art, you can click there, but I'm going to click here right now.
And this is one of the images that we've captured in what we call the <unk> technology.
So this picture, for example, <unk> I think, about 10 million dollars.
And there's a lot of people who ask me, "What do you get with 10,000 million <unk>
So I'm going to show you what you really get with 10 million pixel off.
You can zoom around around very straightforward.
You see things that are going on.
I love this kid, his expression has no price.
But if you really want to get it out.
So I began to play, and I found something that will happen there.
And I said, "A moment, this seems <unk>
I went on and discovered that the kids were actually playing on something.
And I did a little bit of a bit, I talked to some people in the <unk> and I actually discovered that this is a game called <unk> which is to hit a <unk> with a pole <unk>
And apparently it was very popular.
I don't know why they did, but I've learned something about it.
And now we're going to get deeper into depth and you'll see that you can actually get to the cracks.
Now just to give you a little bit of perspective, I'm going to take away the picture, so you'll see really what there is.
This is where we were, and this is the painting.
The best thing is coming, a second.
So now let's quickly jump back at MoMA, in New York.
Here another one of my favorite <unk> <unk>
The example I showed was to find the details.
But what if you want to see the <unk>
And if you want to see how Van Gogh actually created this <unk>
It increases it and really get it out.
I'm going to one of my favorite parts in this picture, and I'm really going to get to the cracks.
This is <unk> <unk> I think I'd never seen it before.
I'm going to show you another one of my favorite functions.
There are a lot more things here, but I don't have a time of <unk>
This is the really cool part. It's called <unk>
All of you, absolutely no matter if it's rich or poor, or if you have a <unk> that gives you the same.
You can online create your own museum, create your own collection out of all these images.
It's very simple, we walked -- I've created this function that I call "The <unk> <unk> -- we just made a zoom around.
This is <unk> in the National Gallery.
You can write things, you send your friends and maintain a conversation about what you feel when you look at these <unk>
So in conclusion, I think for me, the main thing is that all incredible things don't come from Google.
No, in my mind, even neither of the museums.
Maybe I shouldn't say this.
They actually come from those artists.
And that's been my humble experience with this.
I mean, I hope that in this digital medium with its artwork.
And the great question that I'm doing today is you have done this to repeat the experience of going to a <unk>
And the answer is no.
It's to supplement the experience.
And that's it. Thank you.
Thank you.
Good job.
I have something to show you.
Just think it's a <unk>
In our lab we call it sensitive.
I'm going to tell you a little bit about this.
If you look at this picture -- I'm just inspired every child in Italy growing with this picture on the wall of his bedroom. But the reason I show you this is that has happened something really interesting in the race racing in the last two decades.
There was some time, if you wanted to win a race race. One for a budget and put it to a good pilot and a good car.
And if the car and the pilot were good enough, you make the race.
This is what we have in engineering, in engineering, it will be <unk> in real time.
It's essentially a system that has two <unk> a sensor and a <unk>
Today what's interesting is that systems of control in real time are starting to get into our lives.
Our cities, in the last few years, have been covered with networks and electronics.
You're going to open <unk>
And like <unk> they're starting to respond in a different way, and they can be <unk> and <unk>
<unk> cities is a big thing.
As a story -- I wanted to mention that cities are only two percent of the crust of the planet, but they represent 50 percent of the population.
75 percent of the consumption of <unk> and to 80 percent of the CO2 emissions.
If we could do something with the cities, it would be something big.
More than cities, all these <unk> and <unk> are moving into our everyday objects.
This is from an exhibit of <unk> <unk> for the purposes of MoMA, during the summer.
It's called <unk>
Well, our objects, the environment, start <unk>
In some ways, it's like almost all of the existing atoms have been back to sensors and <unk>
And that's changing the interaction that as humans have with the external environment.
In some sense it's almost like in the old dream of Michelangelo.
You know, when Michelangelo <unk> the <unk> tells you that at the end, he took the hammer and he threw it up to the Moses -- you can still see a little <unk> <unk> and he said, "My <unk> <unk> <unk>                             
Well, today, for the first time, our environment starts <unk>
And I'm going to show you just a few <unk> <unk> on the idea of getting the environment and push something.
Let's start with the detection.
The first project I wanted to share with you is actually one of the first projects of our lab.
This was four and a half years ago in Italy.
It was a summer with kind of lucky.
It was the year that Italy won the World Cup in the World
Maybe some of you remember -- they were playing Italy and France, and at the end, they gave the <unk>
And anyway, at the end, I won Italy.
Now let's look at what happened that day looking at gay activity.
So here we see the city.
You see the <unk> in the medium, and the river <unk>
It's the morning, before play.
The timeline.
At the late 1990s, there are people around here, and there do <unk>
It starts the <unk>
<unk> of France.
You know, people make a fast phone call.
Second time. End of time <unk>
The first time <unk> second.
<unk> and at a moment, <unk>
She makes Italy, know!
That night they all went to the center.
There you see the great summit.
The next day everyone went to the center of the <unk> and the first minister of then.
And then the whole world <unk>
You see the picture of the place called <unk> <unk> where, from the time <unk> people are going to <unk> it's a great cocktail party -- you can see the peak at the end of the day.
This is just an example of how you can measure the pulse of the city in a way that we could not have been able to do only a few years ago.
Another quick example of <unk> is not about people, but of things that we use and consume.
Today we know all about the source of our objects.
This is a map that shows all the chips that make up a Mac, how they were <unk>
But we know very little about where things are.
So in this project, we developed some small labels.
We started with some volunteers who helped us in Seattle a little bit more than a year, to tag what were <unk> different kinds of things, as you can see, things that are all <unk>
And then we put a little chip, a little chip, and a little chip, and then we started <unk>
These are the <unk> results.
<unk>
after a week.
With this information we realized that there are a lot of <unk> in the system.
We can do the same with much less energy.
These are data that had no exist before.
They're happening complicated and there's a lot of <unk>
But the other thing we believe is that if you look at every day that the cup that we <unk> not until it's still somewhere on the planet.
If the plastic bottle I <unk> a day still follows there.
So if we show that to people, then we'll be able to promote some change of behavior.
That was the reason for the project.
My colleague at MIT, <unk> <unk> I could tell you a lot more about detecting and lots of other great things that we can do with that, but I wanted to go to the second part that we talked to the beginning -- the principle, which is <unk> on the environment.
And the first project is something we did a couple of years ago in <unk>
It all started with a question of the mayor of the city, who came and told us that Spain and South Europe have a beautiful tradition of the use of water in public space, in architecture.
And the question was, how can technology, the new technology, join that?
And one of the ideas that we developed at MIT, in a shop was, imagine that they have a <unk> and <unk> valves from <unk> <unk> which is open and <unk>
It creates like a curtain of water, with pixels of water.
If you get the pixels in the pixels you can write on them, show you patterns, images, texts.
And you know, the curtain will open up so that we can happen, as you see in the picture.
We presented this to the mayor <unk>
He liked it very much.
And we put a commission to design the building at the entry for the <unk>
We call it <unk> <unk>
All the building is made of water.
There's no doors and no windows -- but when you come up with it, it opens up so that you can go.
The roof is also covered in water.
And if there's a little bit of wind, if you want to minimize the <unk> the <unk>
Or you can close the building and all the architecture goes down like this case.
Those days will always be somebody, in the winter, when the roof, go down there, and he said, <unk> the <unk>
No, it's not that you've got it, but when it comes down almost all the architecture goes away.
Here it is working.
You see the people <unk> by what happens in.
And here I'm myself trying to do not <unk> when the sensors open the water.
I think I should tell you what happened one night when all the sensors stopped working.
That night was really even more fun.
All the kids in <unk> came to the building because the way we interact had changed a little bit.
It was no longer a building that would open to let you happen, but a building that was still making slices and holes of water and you had to jump out to <unk>
<unk> <unk> And for us that was really interesting because as architects, engineers, engineers, we always think about use people to give our designs.
But then reality is always unpredictable.
And that's the beauty of doing things to interact with people use.
This is a picture of the building with the physical pixels -- the pixels of water, and of projections about them.
And this is what led us to think about the next project I'm going to show you.
Imagine that those pixels could begin to fly.
Imagine you could have little helicopter in the air and every one of you had a little pixel that changes color as if it was a cloud that's moving in space.
This is the video.
Imagine a helicopter, like the one that we saw before, which moves with others in synchrony.
We could make this cloud,
A kind of flexible screen, like this with a normal configuration in two dimensions.
Or a normal, but in three dimensions, where what changes is light, not the side.
You can play with a different type.
Imagine the screen appear in different scales and size, in different types of resolution.
And then all of that could be a cloud cloud in 3D that you can get close, and you can see it from very different perspectives.
This is the real <unk> <unk> going down to form a <unk> like before.
When the light goes on, you see this. The same thing we saw before.
Imagine every one of them <unk> a person.
We can have each pixel with a input that comes from people, the movement, and etc., etc.
I want to show you something for the first time.
We have been working with <unk> <unk> <unk> from the best dancers of today, the star of the New York star <unk> and the <unk> of <unk> to capture their movements in 3D and use it as input for <unk>
We can see <unk> dancing.
On the left you see the <unk> the capture in different <unk>
It's so digitization in real time as a motion capture.
It can make the whole movement.
You can go all the way.
And once we have the pixels -- we can play with them, with the color and the movement, with gravity and <unk>
We want to use this as a possible entry for <unk>
I wanted to show you the last project that we're working on.
It's something for the London Olympics.
It's called <unk>
And the idea is, imagine again, that we could engage people to do something and change our environment as an <unk> farm like <unk> but with a cloud.
Imagine that we could make all of them <unk> a little bit for a <unk>
And I think the remarkable thing that has happened in the last few years is that, in the last two decades, we went from the physical world to the digital world.
We've digitized everything like knowledge, and it's accessible through the Internet.
Today, for the first time -- and the Obama campaign will tell us, we can move from the digital world, the potential power, the physical world.
In our case, this might we want to use it to design and make a <unk>
That would mean something built in a city.
But tomorrow can be to address the challenges of today: think about climate change or CO2 emissions. How do we go from the digital world to the physical world?
The idea is that we can get people involved in doing this together, differently.
The cloud is a cloud, again, made of pixels in the same way that the real cloud is a cloud cloud.
And those particles are water, while in our cloud are pixel from the side.
It's a physical structure in London.
You can move around the inside, have different experiences.
You can see from the bottom, to serve to share the main moments of the Olympics, and even more, and can be used as a form of connection with the community.
So it's both a physical cloud of the sky as something that you can go up like a new top of London.
You can get into there.
As if it was a new digital <unk> at night, but the most important thing is to be a new experience for anybody to go to the top.
Thank you.
Would you like to be better than what they are?
So suppose I would tell you that, with just a few changes in their genes, they could improve it by more accurate and faster.
Or maybe you would like to be in better ways, to be stronger to have more resistance.
Would you like to be more attractive and sure you know.
How about living with good health?
Or maybe those people who were always more creative.
So what else would you <unk>
What if you could choose anything?
<unk> of the Audience: <unk> <unk>
How many people are <unk> creativity?
Raise your hand. Let me see.
<unk> I probably had the number of creative creative people present.
That's really good.
How many people want the memory?
A few more.
And the <unk>
A little less.
How about the <unk>
Oh, most of you. That makes me feel very well as a doctor.
If you could have something like this, the world would be very different.
It's just <unk>
Or maybe that possible?
Evolution has been a <unk> subject here at the TED Conference but today I want to give you the look at a doctor on the subject.
The great congregation in the 20th century, <unk> <unk> in addition to <unk> in the Catholic Church -- <unk> wrote a trial called <unk>
But if effectively embrace biological evolution, consider this: it's just about the past, or the future?
It's about others or us?
This is another look at the tree of life.
The human part of this branch, well on one end, is, of course, the more we care about.
<unk> from a common ancestry with modern chimpanzees about six or eight million years ago.
In the interval, there's been maybe 20 -- 25 different species of <unk>
Some of them have gone and <unk>
We have been here about <unk> years now.
It might seem to be very far from other parts of this tree of life, but actually, mostly the basic machinery of our cells is more or less the same.
You realize that we can harness and control the machinery of a common bacterium, to produce the protein of human insulin that is used to treat the <unk>
This is not as human insulin -- but it's the same protein, which comes out of the pancreatic <unk>
And talking about bacteria -- they realize that we all carry on the most bacteria more than the cells we have in the rest of the body?
Maybe 10 times more.
I mean, think -- when Antonio <unk> tells you the <unk> think about <unk>
The gut is a beautifully <unk> environment for those bacteria.
It's warm and dark water, it's very <unk>
And we're going to provide all of the nutrients that you can want to want to have no effort.
It's really like a quick move for the bacteria with the occasional disruption of some rush rush to the output.
But then we are a wonderful environment for those bacteria in the same way that they are essential for our life.
We help digesting nutrients. They protect them from certain diseases.
But what are the future?
We're in a kind of evolutionary balance as a species?
Or to become something different, something probably better <unk>
In this vast <unk> symphony of the universe, life on Earth is like a brief <unk> the animal kingdom, as one and only <unk> and human life, a little note of grace.
That was us.
And it was also the <unk> of this talk, so I hope you have <unk>
When I went to college, I had my first kind of biology.
I was fascinated by the elegance and the beauty of biology.
I fell in love with the power of evolution, and I realized a fundamental thing in most of the existence of life, in the <unk> organisms and every cell simply divides and all the genetic energy of that cell is transmitted to the two cells.
But when organisms appear -- things begin to change.
It enters the sexual reproduction.
And something very important with the emergence of sexual reproduction that passes the genome, the rest of the body becomes <unk>
In fact, you could say that the <unk> of the body death enters the same time of sexual reproduction.
I have to <unk> that when I was a college student thought, well, <unk> death per <unk> it seemed pretty reasonable at that time, but with every year that was happening, every year he had more <unk>
I got to understand the feelings of George <unk> who are still <unk> in Las Vegas in their 90 years.
And one night someone hits his hotel door.
He opens the door.
In front of he is a gorgeous <unk> <unk>
She looks at it and he says, <unk> for a <unk> <unk>
He said, "There's George, "I pick the <unk>
I realized, as a doctor, who was working on a different goal, to the goal of <unk> not necessarily quite different.
I was trying to preserve the body.
I wanted it to be healthy.
I wanted to regain health in the disease.
I wanted us to live more and more healthy.
Evolution is about spending the genome to the next <unk> adapting and <unk> generation after generation.
From an evolutionary point of view, you and I are like rockets <unk> designed to send the genetic burden to the next level, and then let us fall into the sea.
I think all of us <unk> the feeling that Woody Allen when he said, "I don't want to achieve immortality through my job.
I want to <unk> you don't know.
Evolution doesn't necessarily blame the longevity.
It's not necessarily the biggest or the strongest or the strongest or not even more intelligent than even the most.
Evolution benefits the best adapted to their environment.
That's the only proof of survival and success.
In the bottom of the ocean -- the bacteria <unk> that can survive the heat of the <unk> that would be, if there were fish there, fish fish <unk> but they have managed to do that a <unk> environment.
So what does it mean is, when we look at what's happening in evolution and if we look back to think about the place of humans in evolution, and in particular if you look at the <unk> phase.
The first one is not <unk>
We've got a kind of balance.
And the underlying reasoning would be that through medicine, first of all, we have known to preserve a lot of genes that otherwise would have been <unk> and removed from the population.
And second of all, as a species, we have <unk> our environment to be adapted to us as well as we adapt to it.
And by the way, <unk> <unk> and <unk> and so much that it is no longer possible to have the isolation for that evolution.
A second possibility is that you have an evolution of the traditional species, natural type, dictated by the forces of nature.
And the argument here would be, that the gears of evolution roll slowly, but they're <unk>
And in terms of <unk> when as a species -- distant planets are going to exist and environmental changes that can produce evolution in a natural way.
But there's a third possibility -- an intriguing and intriguing possibility and terrifying to me.
I call it <unk> the new evolution, which is not simply <unk> but <unk> and <unk> and <unk> for us as the individuals in the decisions that we make.
Now, how could that happen?
How could we do this?
First consider the reality that many people today, in some cultures, are making decisions about their offspring.
In some cultures, they're choosing to have more males than women.
It's not necessarily good for society, but it's what it takes for the individual and family level.
Just think that if you could actually choose not just the sex of your <unk> but in your own body making the genetic adjustments to cure or prevent disease.
And if we could make genetic changes to remove diabetes or Alzheimer's or reduce the risk of cancer or remove the <unk>
You wouldn't want to make those changes in their <unk>
If you look at the future, that kind of changes is going to be increasingly possible.
The Human Genome Project, started in 1990 and sued 13 years old.
<unk> million dollars.
In the next year, in 2004, in 2004, I could do the same work for 20 million dollars in three or four months.
Today, you can get a whole sequence of three million base pairs in the human genome to a nearby cost.
Not too much for them to make the human genome for <unk> and to be increasingly more and more and more and more at all.
You get those changes.
The same technology that has produced the human insulin in bacteria can make viruses that are not only going to protect us from themselves, but they're going to induce some other viruses.
<unk> or there's no experimental trial in the course of the flu flu vaccine.
You can imagine a good thing that comes out of the <unk>
That's actually today, and in the future, it's going to be more and more possible.
Imagine just another two little <unk>
They can change the cells from their bodies but if they could change the cells from their <unk>
And if you could change the sperm and the <unk> or change the <unk> egg and give your children a better chance for a more healthy life, remove the diabetes, to remove the risk of cancer?
Who doesn't want more <unk>
And then, that same technology <unk> that same motor of science that can produce the changes to prevent diseases that are going to allow us to support <unk> <unk> a better memory.
Why not have the ingenuity of a <unk> <unk> especially if you could get it with the next generation of the vending machine.
Why not have a <unk> muscle to allow us to run faster and more <unk>
Why not live longer?
This is going to be <unk>
And when we are in conditions to pass this to the next generation and we can take the attributes that we wanted to take the evolution of before in <unk>
We're going to take a process that would normally take 100 years -- and we can go to 1,000 years and maybe happen within the next 100 years.
These are choices that their grandchildren, or the grandchildren of their grandchildren, will have to have them.
We're going to use these choices in a society of a better society, more <unk>
Or, let's choose different attributes that we want for some of us, but not for everybody else?
We're going to build a society that is more boring and more uniform and more robust and more <unk>
This is the kind of question we're going to have to face.
And the most profound thing about all: we're going to be able to develop the wisdom and inherit the wisdom necessary to make these decisions.
For good or for bad, and before what I could do, these choices are going to depend on us.
Thank you.
Imagine a big explosion when you're at 900 feet tall.
Imagine a plane full of smoke.
Imagine a motor doing <unk> <unk> <unk>
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
Well, I had a unique seat that day -- I was sitting in <unk>
It was the only one that I could talk about with flight <unk>
So I immediately looked at them, and they said, "There's no problem. You probably hit some <unk>
The pilot had taken up the plane, and we weren't so far.
You could see Manhattan.
Two minutes later, three things happened at the same time.
The pilot picks the plane with the Hudson River.
Normally that's not the way.
<unk> the motors.
Imagine being on an airplane and <unk>
And then he said three words ...
The three most <unk> words I've ever heard of.
He said, <unk> for the <unk>
I didn't have to talk more with the <unk>
I could see it in his eyes.
Life <unk>
I want to share with you three things that I learned about myself that day.
I learned that everything changes at a moment.
We have this list of things to do before they die, these things that we want to do in life, and I thought about all the people that I wanted to come up and I didn't, all the fences that I wanted to have and never <unk>
As I thought about that later -- I got a sentence, which is, <unk> wines down.
Because if the wine is ready and the person is there, I'm going to open.
I don't want to do anything in life.
And that urgency, that is really changed my life.
The second thing I learned that day -- and this is while <unk> the George Washington, which was not for a lot -- I thought about -- wow, I really feel a big <unk>
I've lived a good life.
In my humanity, and my mistakes I've tried to improve all I did.
But in my humanity, also led to my ego.
And I'm going to love the time that I think about things that I didn't care about with people who do matter.
And I thought about my relationship with my wife, with my friends, with the people.
And then, like <unk> in that, I decided to remove the negative energy of my life.
It's not perfect, but it's much better.
In two years, I haven't had a fight with my wife.
It feels like <unk>
I don't try to have a reason to be <unk>
The third thing I learned -- and this is like your mental clock is going to be <unk> <unk> 14, <unk>
You see the water <unk>
I'm saying, "Please get <unk>
I don't want this to be <unk> in 20 pieces as you see in those <unk>
And as I went on, I had the feeling of, Wow, will die not fear.
It's almost like we've been <unk> for it all our life.
But it was very sad.
I didn't want to <unk> I love my life.
And that sadness is <unk> in a single thought, which is, just wish one thing.
I wish I could see my children grow.
One month later, I was in an art in my performance -- first grade, not a lot of artistic talent --  And I scream, <unk> as a little boy.
And to me, that was the whole reason for the world.
At that point, I understood those two points, that the only thing that matters in my life is a great father.
Over all, the only goal I have in life is a good father.
He gave me a miracle of not die that day.
And he gave me another gift, which was the possibility of looking at the future and come back and live differently.
And you who are flying today, the challenge that you can imagine that the same thing happens in their plane -- and please not be that -- but you can imagine, and how you are."
What are you going to do, that you're still waiting to do because they think they're going to live <unk>
How do you change your relationships and negative energy in them?
And most importantly, they're the best parents who are <unk>
Thank you.
I've clearly been <unk> in life.
But the biggest thing that I worked was for this guy.
The guy is called <unk>
<unk> was one of the most important <unk> in the '80s.
One day he came to his house after he running and said, "Dad, I feel a <unk> in the <unk>
And that was the beginning of ALS.
Today <unk> has total paralysis,
You can only use your eyes.
Her work in me.
I have a design company and animation so that, of course, graffiti is something that we admire and <unk> in the world.
So we decided that we were going to <unk> to <unk> <unk> and their cause.
So I went and met his brother and his father and I said, "We're going to give you this money.
What are you going to do with <unk>
And his brother said, "I just want to be able to talk to Tony again.
I just want to be able to communicate with it, and he will be able to communicate with me."
And I said, "A second, not that <unk> you see Stephen <unk> not that all people with paralysis can communicate through those <unk>
And he said, "No, unless you're really important and having a secure insurance -- you can't actually do it.
These devices are not affordable for people."
And I said, "Well, how do you communicate then?"
Somebody saw the movie "The <unk> and the <unk>
They communicate with that way, they go <unk>
I said, "That's <unk> How can it be?"
So I was presented with the only desire to deliver a check and instead of that he signed a check that I didn't have the lowest idea of how I was going to <unk>
And I went on with his brother and his father there at that particular time, "All right, this is <unk> Tony's going to build a machine, and we'll find a way to make his art again.
Because it's ridiculous that someone who has so much in your inside can't be <unk>
So I talked about a couple months a couple months later.
I met these guys called <unk> Research Research, which have a technology that allows them to project a light on any surface, and then with a laser pointer -- you have to record the negative space.
So they go through doing art facilities like this.
All the things that <unk> they say, are part of a life cycle.
They first start with sexual organs, then with bad words, after the bad words, and finally, people start doing art.
But there was always a cycle of life in his <unk>
And it started the journey.
And about two years later, about a year later, after a lot of organization and a lot of organization moving things from one side to another we had done a couple of things.
One, you touch the doors of insurance companies, and we get a machine to make it out, I could take a machine like Stephen <unk>
Which was great.
And seriously, it's the most <unk> I call it <unk> because when you talk to the guy who gets an email from it, and you say, "Don't do it." This guy's <unk>
The other thing we did was to bring seven programmers from all the world <unk> from every single corner of the <unk> to our house.
My wife, the kids, and I went to the garage, and these hackers and programmers and <unk> and <unk> took control of the house.
A lot of our friends thought that we were doing something totally stupid and when they were born, they would have taken off the frames of the walls and they would have <unk>
But for two weeks, we went to the <unk> <unk> my son was part, my dog too, and we created this.
It's called <unk>
They are a couple of <unk> sun <unk> that we bought in the <unk> <unk> Beach, some copper rose and <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk>
We take a camera -- we <unk> we put it on a light light and now there's a device that is free -- and then we build the code code, we published the software code, the software goes down to free.
And we created a device that has no limitation at all.
There's no insurance company to say "No."
There is no hospital that can say "No."
Any person with paralysis today has access to draw and communicate with just their eyes.
Thank you.
Thank you very much for you. That was amazing.
So at the end of the two weeks we went back to the <unk> room.
I love this picture because this is the <unk> room and that's his room.
There was all this <unk> and <unk> during the big <unk>
And after more than a year of planning, two weeks of designing a few weeks of programming all night, Tony <unk> went back for the first time in seven years.
And this is a wonderful picture because this is the support system in his life, and it's looking through the support system.
We ran the bed so I could see it.
And we put a projector on a wall of the car parking lot out of the hospital.
And he went back to draw for the first time in front of his family and friends -- and you can imagine, the feeling in the parking lot.
The funny thing was that we had to take off the parking lot, so we feel like we were <unk> graffiti as well.
At the end of this, he sent us an email and this was what was like, "This was the first time I drew in seven years.
I felt like I had been under the water, and someone finally came to <unk> and I would take me out there so that I could <unk>
It's not <unk>
In a certain way, that's our scream for war.
That's what keeps us in motion, <unk>
And we have a long way to go through this.
This is a great device -- but it's the equivalent of a <unk>
Someone with this artistic potential deserves a lot more.
So we're trying to figure out how to figure out how to make it faster and robust.
We have had all kinds of recognition.
We've won lots of prizes.
Remember, it's <unk> none of us is doing money with this.
Everything comes out of our own pockets.
The prizes were <unk> "Oh, this is <unk>
Armstrong <unk> something about us, and then, in December, the Time magazine recognized that as one of the largest <unk> inventions of 2010, and it was really great.
The best thing about this -- and this is what ends up the <unk> is that in April of this year at the center of Los Angeles is going to be an exhibit called <unk> in the <unk>
And <unk> in the <unk> is going to have the best <unk> of <unk> urban art, <unk> <unk> -- all of them will be there.
<unk> is going to be on the show which is pretty amazing.
So, basically this is my idea: If you look at something that is not possible, as possible.
None of what there is in this room was possible -- scenario, the computer, the microphone, nothing was possible at a certain moment.
Make it <unk> anything in this room.
I'm not a programmer, I never did anything with cutting-edge recognition technology, I just recognized something and gave me with wonderful people to make it happen.
And these are the questions that I want all of us to do every day when we find something that we feel that you have to do with something that we feel that if it's not now, <unk> and if I'm not me who I'm like, "Who am I doing?
Thank you guys.
I've spent the last few years in situations generally very hard and at the same time as dangerous as well.
I went to the hard <unk>
I worked on a dangerous mine.
It was in areas of <unk> difficult and dangerous <unk>
And I spent 30 days of just eating just a little bit fun at first, something hard in the middle, very dangerous at the end.
In fact, in a lot of my career, I've been <unk> in very horrible situations with the only goal to treat.
So when I knew that I was coming here to make a TEDTalk on the world of brands and <unk> I wanted to do something a little bit differently.
So some of you may have heard or not, a couple of weeks ago, I took a <unk>
I sent a few messages on Facebook, some on Twitter, offered to sell the rights of my TEDTalk in 2011.
The thing that had was this: <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> my TEDTalk that you have no idea what it is and according to content could be <unk> in the face, especially if I put it in ridiculous to your company to do it.
But he said this, it's a very good opportunity.
Do you know how many people look at these <unk>
<unk>
It's a title in progress, by the way.
So even with that <unk> I knew somebody was going to buy the rights.
If you had asked me a year ago, I wouldn't have been able to hold it with certain.
But in the new film that I'm working on, we looked at the world of <unk>
And as I said before, I went into horrible situations in the last few years, but nothing could be <unk> for something as difficult or as dangerous as getting into the rooms with these guys.
You see, I had this idea for a movie.
Morgan <unk> I want to make a film that try to make a product of products, marketing and advertising, and that all the film would be <unk> with <unk> marketing and marketing and advertising.
The movie is going to call "The biggest <unk>
What happens in "The biggest <unk> is that everything from top at the bottom of the end, has a brand, and all the time from the <unk> that appears before the title -- the <unk>
Now this brand, <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
These people were <unk> in the film to <unk>
And so the film explores all this idea -- <unk> <unk> is what? <unk> It's <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
I'm a <unk> <unk> <unk> It was more by <unk>
It was <unk> forever."
But we're not just going to have the sponsor of the X mark in the title but we're going to make sure it will take all the categories that we could in the film.
Maybe you get a shoe and it becomes the most great shoe you have <unk>
You know, the biggest car you ever <unk> in "The biggest <unk> you ever get the best drink than you have <unk> <unk>
<unk> <unk> The idea is so also to show brands as part of life, making them <unk> <unk> to make it <unk> MS: And we actually show the whole process of how it works.
The whole goal of the film is transparency.
You're going to see all the process in this film.
That's the full idea, the whole shot of principle to end.
And I would love to make it happen.
Robert <unk> You know, it's funny because it's the first time I hear that -- is the most respect for the audience.
<unk> I don't know how <unk> is going to be the people at that.
<unk> You have a <unk> -- I don't know if you look at it -- it's very <unk> but you know how it's going to <unk> <unk> No <unk>
MS: A million and a half million and a half million <unk> <unk> <unk> John <unk> I think it's going to be hard to the meeting of them, but certainly it's going to be worth convincing a couple of big brands,
<unk> Who knows, for the moment that comes out the movie -- let's look at it as a lot of fucking <unk>
MS: What do you think is going to be the answer?
Stuart <unk> Most of the answers will be "No."
MS: But it's going to be hard to spread through the film or because of me.
JK: Both of these things.
MS: <unk> means you're not very optimistic.
So I <unk> I need help.
MK: I can help.
MS: Very well.
MK: We have to think about which brands.
MS: Yeah. It's <unk> That's the <unk> When you look at the people that you have to <unk>
MK: We have some places where to go. <unk> <unk> <unk>
MS: I thought <unk> <unk> meant we have a conversation outside the microphone.
<unk> the camera means "We don't want to know any of your <unk>
MS: And so it was, one by one, all these companies suddenly disappear.
No one wanted to have anything to do with this film.
I was shocked.
They didn't want to know anything with this project.
And he got very <unk> I thought the concept of advertising, was to introduce the product to so many people as possible, to make so many people as possible.
Especially in the world today is this intersection of new media and old media, and the global media scenario -- is not the idea to tell that new vehicle worthy of attention that will lead the message to the <unk>
No, that was what I thought.
But the problem was, you know, my idea had a <unk> error and that error was this.
Actually, no, there was no mistake.
There was no mistake at all.
This would have been okay.
But the problem was what this picture.
See, when you look for images of Google <unk> --  --  -- this is one of the first images that were going on.
I like <unk> Sergey <unk> No.
This was the problem: The <unk> free of simulation or easily <unk> or <unk> easily <unk> which is characterized by the visibility or access to information, especially in <unk> practices -- the last line is probably the biggest problem.
You see, we heard a lot about transparency in these days.
Our politicians <unk> President <unk> even the CEOs <unk>
But suddenly when it comes to make it really something changes very suddenly.
But why? Well, transparency gives rise --  like that rare bear that is still <unk>
It's <unk>    Like this rare path.
And it's also very risky.
So what else is it <unk>
You know, a whole bowl of <unk> <unk>
That's really risky.
When I began to talk to the companies and to tell you that we wanted to tell this story, and they said, "No, we want me to have <unk> history.
We want them to take a story, but we want to make them <unk> story."
See, when I was a kid, and my father would get me in some lie -- and that's where he was looking at me as I used to say, "Son, there's three sides in every story.
He's your story, there's my story, and there's the <unk> story.
As you can see, in this film, we wanted to tell the real story.
But with just a company, an agency wanting to help me -- and that just because I knew John Bond and Richard <unk> of many years -- I realized that I would have to go on my own, I would have to take off the classroom and go to the companies same with my team.
So what I started to see from a sudden, and that I started to realize -- is that when you start talking with the companies the idea of understanding your mark is a universal problem.
MS: I have friends who make large films big, enormous films and others that make small films like mine.
And my friends who make films of big Hollywood films say that the reason that their films have so much success is due to the brands associated with them.
And then my friends who make independent films say, "Well, how are we supposed to go to compete with these big, giant films of <unk>
And the movie is called "The largest <unk>
How are we going to see specifically in the film?
Every time I'm going to go out, every time I open my <unk> you'll see the <unk> <unk>
At any time for an interview with someone I can say, "You're good for this <unk>
You're ready? You get a little nervous.
I want to help you <unk>
Maybe you should put a little bit of this before the <unk>
And there's one of these <unk> <unk>
<unk> <unk> like <unk> of <unk> are going to have their opportunity.
We're going to have so much for a man like to <unk> <unk> to <unk> in bar, whatever.
That's the big story.
Now I can answer your questions and give you a look at <unk>
Karen Frank: We are a little bit.
We put it into the smallest type of films that are more than <unk>
So we don't have the budget that other brands.
So do things like that, you know, remind people is the reason why this interest us.
MS: What words use to describe <unk>
<unk> is in white.
<unk> That's a big question.
Woman: Wow.
MS: Technology is not the way you want to describe something that you put in <unk>
Man: We talk about something bold <unk>
I think it's a great word that really puts this category in positive versus <unk> smell and <unk>
It keeps you so cool.
How do you keep it cool over time, with better <unk> three times more <unk>
Things like those who are <unk> the benefits.
MS: And that's a <unk> company.
What's about me? What about a common kind of things.
I need to talk to the guy from the street, and people like me, <unk>
They have to talk about my brand.
MS: How do you define your <unk>
Man: <unk> my <unk>
I don't know.
I like good clothing.
Woman: reviving the '80s, <unk> <unk> unless it comes from <unk>
MS: All right, what is the <unk>
<unk> Something -- <unk> <unk> Man: I guess the kind of gender, the style that I have would be like a <unk> <unk>
I like a lot of dark colors, lots of gray and things like that.
And so I'm usually wearing steps like sunglasses, or I like crystals and similar <unk>
Woman: If Dan was a mark could be a <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
Man 2: The mark that I am, I would say <unk> <unk>
Woman 2: In part of <unk> in part <unk> in part <unk> <unk> I don't know.
Man 3: I'm the type of pet pets.
They provide toys for pets in the country and in the world.
So I guess that's my brand.
In my small sector, that's my brand.
Man 4: My mark is because they were <unk> <unk>
Man 5: <unk> <unk> failure.
Is that that?
<unk> I am <unk>
<unk> I'm <unk>
MS: Well, not all of us can all be brand Tom, but I often went on the intersection of <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk>
I realized I needed an expert.
He needed someone who could go into my mind, someone who could help me understand what they call the <unk> of <unk>
And I found a company called <unk> <unk> in Pittsburgh.
They helped companies like <unk> <unk> <unk> to find that personality of brand.
If they were able to do it for them, you could certainly do it for me.
<unk> <unk> <unk> right?
MS: Yeah. The first picture is a family picture.
AT: Tell me a little bit about how it relates to your thoughts and feelings of your way.
MS: These people make my way to see the world.
AT: Tell me about that world.
MS: That world? So I think your world is the world in which they are <unk> like the people around you, your family, the way you live your life, the work you have.
All of those things come up and start in a place and in my case they come up and start in my family West Virginia.
AT: What's the next thing you want to talk about.
MS: The next thing is "This was the best day in my life."
AT: How does this relate to your thoughts, feelings and your form of that?
MS: It's like who I'd like to be me.
I like things different.
I like the weird stuff. I like the weird stuff.
AT: Tell me about <unk>
What's the <unk> In which phase of <unk> you find it now?
Why is it important <unk> What is the <unk>
Tell me a little bit about that.
A little bit more than you, which is not who you are.
What other <unk> have you <unk>
You don't have to be afraid.
MS: <unk> <unk> Thank you.
AT: Thank you for your patience. Great <unk> Oh yeah. Thank you very much.) Very good.
MS: Yeah, I don't know what is going to come out of this.
There was a lot of madness in all this.
<unk> <unk> The first thing that I saw was this idea that there are two different sides that there are two different sides of <unk> the mark Morgan <unk> is a <unk> brand.
They were <unk> very well.
And I think there's almost a paradox in them.
And I think that some companies will only be <unk> in one of your strong points or the other instead of focusing on both.
A lot of companies tend to -- and it's nature <unk> to avoid the things that are not <unk> and avoid fear of fear, and you actually get a really good thing for you, and it's nice to see that.
How other brands are it?
The first here is the classic Apple.
And you can also see <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk>
Now there are playful brands and brands and brands -- those things that have gone and come but a <unk> mark is something quite powerful.
MS: <unk> which is your <unk>
If someone tells you to give your identity of brand, your personal personality -- what would that be?
Are you a <unk> attribute for you. You're somebody who makes blood <unk>
Or are you more good for a <unk>
<unk> <unk>
The attributes of <unk> are kind of playful to be cool as <unk> contemporary <unk> or bold or bold or bold <unk> or <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> or <unk> <unk> <unk> or <unk> or <unk> or <unk> like <unk>
Or are you more of the <unk>
You're <unk> sophisticated as <unk>
You're <unk> traditional <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
You're reliable -- stable, family familiar, safe, <unk> <unk> or wise -- like the Dalai Lama or <unk>
In the course of this movie we had more than 500 companies, <unk> and <unk> who say, <unk> they didn't want to be part of this project.
They didn't want to have anything to do with this film, mostly because it would have no control, no control over the end.
They allowed us to tell the story of <unk> and we got to tell the story in this movie of how we now use MRI in order to identify the centers of desire in the brain so much for marketing and commercial marketing for film.
We went to San Francisco, where they have forbidden outdoor <unk>
In the entire city for the last five years, there's no <unk> there's no <unk> no <unk>
And we went to school districts in which corporations are getting the way on the schools with copyright problems in the United States.
The incredible thing for me is that the projects in which I have had the biggest answer or the most success that I've been able to interacted with things directly.
And that's what these brands.
They went to the <unk> they went to their agencies, and they said maybe these agencies have no best interest in mind.
I'm going to deal with the artist.
I'm going to work with him to create something different, something that will make people think about the people who are going to challenge the way we look at the world.
And how have he gone? <unk>
Well, since the movie was sent out, let's take a look.
According to <unk> the movie was released in January, and since then -- and this is not <unk> we've had 900 million impressions in the media for this film.
This covers just a period of two weeks and a half.
That's just <unk> no press, no press and TV.
The movie is still not <unk>
It's still not online. It's not in <unk>
They haven't even been presented in other countries yet.
Ultimately, this movie has started to gain lead.
And it's not bad because most of the agencies who are talking about giving them to their customers not to be part.
I've always believed that if you take risks, if you take risks, that in those risks are opportunity.
I think that when you get away from the people that are pushing them to fail.
I think that when you train your employees at the risk of risk is preparing for all their company to make it <unk>
I feel that what has to happen to advance is that we have to encourage people to <unk>
We have to encourage the people who are not afraid of the opportunities that they can afford.
Ultimately, forward, I think we have to give it to the fear.
We have to put that bear in a cage.
<unk> fear <unk>
From a <unk> at the time, we have to embrace risk.
And ultimately, we have to support transparency.
Now more than ever a bit of honesty is going to go a long way.
And he said this, with honesty and transparency, all my talk -- the <unk> -- has been presented for my good friends of <unk> who for <unk> bought the rights of the name in <unk>
<unk> <unk> big data in great opportunities for companies around the world.
<unk> presents the <unk>
Thank you very much.
June Cohen: So so, let's get it on behalf of transparency, who happened exactly with those <unk>
MS: It's a fantastic question.
In my pocket I have a check for the name of the TED matrix the <unk> Foundation, and to be applied to my assistance for TED of the next year.
The idea behind the <unk> <unk> is actually very simple.
We don't want Iran to get the nuclear bomb.
Their biggest asset to develop nuclear weapons is the <unk> plant plant in <unk>
The gray boxes that you see are systems of control in real time.
If we managed to compromise these systems that control speeds and <unk> we can do a lot of problems with the <unk>
<unk> don't use <unk> software -- are a completely different technology.
But if we managed to put an effective virus from Windows in a laptop computer used by an engineer to set up this gray box, so we're smart.
This is the plan behind <unk>
We started with a Windows.
The <unk> enters the gray box -- it hurts the <unk> and the Iranian nuclear program is <unk> mission.
Is it easy, huh?
I want to tell you how we discovered this.
When we started looking at <unk> six months ago, the purpose was completely unknown
The only thing that I knew is that it's very, very complex at the part of <unk> <unk> I used multiple vulnerabilities <unk>
It seemed like to want to do something with these gray boxes, these <unk>
That called us the attention, and we started an experiment where we would take our environment with <unk> and we saw what was going on with this.
So they went very strange.
<unk> <unk> as a computer rat who didn't like our <unk> the wave, but he didn't want to eat.
I had no sense for me.
And after experimenting with different cheese, of cheese, I realized, and I thought, this is a <unk> attack.
It's completely <unk>
<unk> is looking for actively looking at the gray box if you find a specific configuration, and even if the program that is trying to infect is effectively working on that place.
If not, it doesn't do anything.
So that called my attention, and we started working on this almost 24 hours a day, because we said, "We don't know what <unk> is.
It could be, let's say, for example, a energy plant, or a chemical plant in Germany.
You better get the goal up.
And so we extracted and <unk> the attack, and we discovered that it was <unk> in two <unk> <unk> a small and big.
We also saw that they were very professionally <unk> by people who obviously had all the internal information.
You know, all the points for which attack.
I probably even know how long the operator.
So you know everything.
And if you have heard that <unk> <unk> is complex and high technology, let me tell you the burden is very complex.
It's very above everything we've seen before.
Here you see a sample of this code of attack.
We're talking about about 15 lines of code.
It looks like old language <unk>
I want to tell you how we could find sense to this code.
What we were looking at was calls to the functions of the system because we know what they do.
And then we were looking at <unk> and structures of data, and we were trying to engage them with the real world, with potential real-world goals.
We need theories about that we can pass or <unk>
So to get to the theories of goals -- we remember which is definitely a violent <unk> it must be a cold white -- and it's probably located in Iran, because it's where most infections has been <unk>
They don't find several thousand goals in that area.
It basically goes down to the nuclear energy plant plant and the <unk> plant plant.
So I told my <unk> <unk> a list of all experts in <unk> and energy plants between our <unk>
And I called them and I went to an effort for <unk> their experience with what we found in code and data.
And it worked pretty well.
So we were able to associate the little digital <unk> with control of <unk>
The rotor is that part of that mobile piece inside the <unk> that black object you see.
If you run the speed of this <unk> you can certainly be able to take it and even make it <unk>
So what we also saw is that the goal of the attack was to make it slow and <unk> in an obvious effort to <unk> the nest engineers, so that they couldn't solve this quickly.
We try to figure out the big digital <unk> looking at the data and their structures.
So for example, the number <unk> <unk> in that code, you can't get it.
I started looking at scientific literature on how these <unk> are built in <unk> and I found that they're <unk> in what is called a <unk> and every waterfall has <unk> <unk>
That makes sense, a coincidence.
And it got better yet.
These <unk> in Iran are <unk> in 15 parts called stages.
And guess what we found in code <unk>
A almost <unk> structure.
So again, that was a good coincidence.
This gave us a lot of confidence to understand what we had in my hands.
So that was not <unk>
The results have been there after several weeks of hard work.
<unk> <unk> in dead ends.
Yet, we discovered that both digital <unk> would look at one and same goal, but from different perspectives.
<unk> small is taking a <unk> and making those <unk> and <unk> and the big <unk> it communicates with six water and manipulating <unk>
In <unk> we're really comfortable where we have determined what is <unk>
It's <unk> and it's just <unk>
We shouldn't worry about other goals are <unk> by <unk>
So here I show you some really interesting things that we saw -- really <unk>
There's the gray box here, and the top of the <unk>
So what this thing is doing is <unk> the stock values for example of sensors and pressure sensors and it provides <unk> which is still running during the attack, with false <unk>
And believe it or not, these false <unk> data is <unk> by <unk>
It's like in the Hollywood movies where, during the <unk> the safety camera is feeding video <unk>
Is it great huh?
The idea here is obviously not just <unk> on the <unk>
It's really much more dangerous and <unk>
The idea is <unk> a digital security.
We need digital security systems where a human operator could not act fast.
For example, in a energy plant, when the big steam steam goes from velocity, you have to open valves in a <unk>
Of course, this cannot be a human operator for it.
That's where we need digital security.
And when you're <unk> then you can spend bad things.
<unk>
And neither the <unk> no security system is <unk>
That scares you.
But it can be worse.
What I'm going to say is really important.
Think about this. This attack is <unk>
It has nothing to see, specifically with <unk> with <unk> <unk>
It could work as well, for example, in a energy plant, or a new factory for a <unk>
It's <unk>
And you don't have any <unk> <unk> who spread this burden with a key key -- like we saw in the case of <unk>
You could also use conventional technology for <unk>
It would be more than possible.
And if you made that, with what they <unk> is with a <unk> of mass destruction.
That's the consequence we need to face.
Unfortunately, the biggest number of goals for such attacks is not in the Middle East <unk>
It's in the United States and in Japan.
All green areas are spaces with large number of goals.
We have to deal with the consequences, and better than we have to make it now.
Thank you.
Chris Anderson: I have a question.
<unk> has been public in many sides that people assume that <unk> is the number behind this.
What's your <unk>
Ralph <unk> OK, really want to hear this?
Yeah. <unk>
My view is that <unk> is involved but the engine is not <unk>
The motor behind this is the <unk> superpower here.
There's one alone, and that's the United States, fortunately, <unk>
Because, anyway, our problems would be even larger.
CA: Thank you, <unk> Thank you, <unk>
I want you to imagine a robot that can be able to take and give them a <unk> skills or another one that will make users from the wheels, come up and get to walk.
In <unk> <unk> we call these robots, <unk>
They are not different from something that gets in the morning, gives you a great force that is also increases its velocity, and helps it help, for example, handle <unk>
It's actually the real integration of man and the machine.
But not only that -- it can integrate it and connecting it to the universe and with other things <unk>
This is not a <unk> idea.
In order to show you now what we're working on, we started to talk about the American soldier which, on average, must take on their back a <unk> load of 45 pounds, and it's <unk> to take more team.
Obviously, this leads to some important complications in the back in 30 percent of the soldiers -- with chronic damage from back.
We decided to look at this challenge and create a exoskeleton that could help handle the matter.
Let me introduce you to the <unk> -- or <unk> <unk> <unk>
Soldier: With the exoskeleton exoskeleton -- I can take it 90 pounds for more variables for many hours.
Its flexible design allows you to put in <unk> <unk> and running with big <unk>
I want to do what I want to do, or where I want to go, and then it increases my strength and my <unk>
<unk> <unk> We're ready, with our industrial partner to produce this device, this new <unk> this year.
I mean, it's a reality.
So let's go back to the users of chairs from wheels, about what I feel particularly passionate about.
There are 68 million people, roughly, in chairs of wheels, around the world.
As one percent of the population.
And this is a really conservative.
We talk about something that happens very young people very young people in the spine in the spine that they would start their life -- to 20, 30 years -- collide against a wall and the wheelchair turns out to be its only option.
We also talk about the population that is <unk> very quickly.
His only choice, many times -- for a brain injury or some other complication -- is the chair of it.
And this has been so much for the last 500 years, from their successful <unk> as I must recognize.
So we decided to start to write a new chapter about mobility.
Let me introduce you to the <unk> which is using Amanda <unk> who took a injury in the neocortical column, and as a result he could not go back for 19 years, until now.
Amanda <unk> Thank you.
EB: Amanda is using our <unk> <unk>
It has some sensors.
It completely didn't fit in the crutches who send signals to the online computer here on the back.
There are a few batteries that give energy to the motors in the <unk> and in the knees, and they make it forward with this very natural <unk>
AB: I was 24 years old at the top of my life, when, for a weird leap in the air, skiing down <unk>
In a fraction of a second, I lost every feeling and all the motion of <unk>
Little later, a doctor went to my room in the hospital, and he said, "I'll never go to <unk>
That happened 19 years ago.
So I stole up to the last little bit of hope of my being.
<unk> technology, since then, has allowed me to learn <unk> it costs up on <unk> climbing rocks and even riding bike <unk>
But they haven't invented anything that would allow me to walk, until now.
Thank you.
EB: So you can see, we have the technology, we have the platforms to sit and talk to you.
It's in our hands, and we have the whole potential here to change life to future generations, not just soldiers, but Amanda, and all the users of <unk> to everyone.
AB: Thank you.
I just returned from a community that has the secret of human survival.
It's a place where women have <unk> practice sex to say, hello, and play is the order of the day -- where fun is serious.
And no, it's not the <unk> festival.
Ladies and gentlemen, I know their cousins.
This is the world of <unk> in the forests of Congo.
The Bonobos are along with the chimps, their closest relatives.
That means that we all share a common ancestor, an evolutionary grandmother, who lived about six million years ago.
Now, the chimps are known for their <unk>
But unfortunately, we've done too much emphasis on this way in our narratives of human evolution.
But the Bonobos show us the other side of the coin.
Whereas the chimps are dominated by large types, <unk> society Bonobos in charge of females with power.
These guys have created something special because this leads to a very tolerant society, where lethal violence is still not <unk>
But unfortunately, the Bonobos are the least <unk> of the great apes.
They live in the deep <unk> forest and it has been really hard to <unk>
Congo is a <unk> an extraordinary land of extraordinary biodiversity and beauty, but also the heart of <unk> <unk> scenario of a violent conflict that has been sustained for decades and caused almost as many deaths as the First World War.
It's no wonder that this destruction will also put the survival of the Bonobo.
<unk> trade and deforestation, they do that you can't fill in a stadium with the Bonobos that are in the world -- and honestly, we're not sure of it.
However, in this land of violence, and chaos you can hear the hidden laughter -- the trees.
Who are these <unk>
We know how the apes <unk> love, not <unk> because they have sex and <unk> and <unk> to handle conflict and solve social problems.
I'm not saying that this is the solution to all the problems of humanity, because the life of Bonobos is more than <unk> <unk>
<unk> like humans, they love playing throughout their lifetime.
Play is not just a game.
For us and for them the game is critical to establish links and encourage <unk>
With him we learn <unk> and we learn the rules of play.
Play increases creativity and resilience, and it has to do with the generation of <unk> diversity of interactions, diversity of connections.
And when you look at the Bonobo Bonobo sees the root root of the laughter -- the dance, and the personal ritual and the task and the play.
The game is the glue that unites us.
I don't know how you play -- but I want to show you a few unique videos from the wild.
First, it's a ball of ball <unk> and I don't talk about football.
Here's a female, and a young male male in the middle of a <unk>
Look what it is doing it.
It could be the actual origin of the phrase: <unk> has <unk>
I just think that in this case to him, right?
Yeah.
So the sex game is common as much in Bonobos as in humans.
And this video is really interesting because we were looking at this video really interesting because it shows the invention of bringing together unusual elements of the game -- like the <unk> and also how the game requires trust and <unk> <unk> and at the same time is the most fun.
But play is <unk>
<unk> is <unk> it can take a lot of forms, some of which are more <unk> <unk> <unk> maybe the place where the wonder.
And I want you to <unk> this is <unk> a young female, who is playing with a <unk>
I think, like that, we sometimes play themselves, and explore the limits of our inner worlds, and outside.
And it's that playful curiosity that propels us to focus on, and then the unexpected connections that we formed are the real <unk> of creativity.
These are just small samples of understanding that Bonobos give us from our past and present.
But they also have a secret for our future, a future where we have to adapt to a increasingly difficult world with greater creativity and more cooperation.
The secret is that play is the key to these capabilities.
In other words, play is our <unk>
To adapt to a world that changes we have to play.
But you know, at the most of our capacity to game?
The game is not <unk>
play is essential.
For Bonobos and humans, life is not just cruel and <unk>
When you look at the least appropriate play, they can be the times when it's the most <unk>
So they agreed to accept this gift of evolution and play together while <unk> creativity, friendship and wonder.
Thank you.
In New York -- I'm responsible for a nonprofit organization called Robin <unk>
When I'm not battling poverty, <unk> fires like a captain in a fire fire department volunteers.
And in our city, where volunteers belong to a highly skilled <unk> you have to get to the fire site very soon to get into action.
I remember my first fire.
I was the second volunteer on the site, so I had a pretty high probability of go.
But there was still a race to the other volunteers to get to the captain in charge and find out what our homework.
When I found <unk> I was <unk> in a conversation with the owner that certainly <unk> one of the worst days of his life.
We were in full night, she was standing out in the rain, under a <unk> in his pajamas -- he was on fire.
The other volunteer that I had just got to get before me, <unk> <unk> --  came first to the captain and he asked her to go back and save the dog owner.
<unk> I was <unk> <unk>
There was a lawyer or <unk> of money that for the rest of his life, I would have to tell the people who entered a building in order to save a live self just because I won for five seconds.
Well, I was the next.
The captain made me a <unk>
He said, <unk> I need for the house.
I need that <unk> <unk> the fire, and I bring this woman a pair of shoes."
I <unk>
It was not exactly what I was waiting for, but I went on the stairs, I got the stairs, at the end of the hall went to the firemen <unk> who at that height had ended up on the fire and went into the main room for a pair of shoes.
I know what you're thinking, but I'm not a hero.
I took my burden on the staircase where I met my <unk> and the beautiful dog on the front door.
<unk> from the house owner for the house owner where, as she was waiting for his rose got much more attention than mine.
A few weeks later the apartment got a letter from the company's owner of the <unk> <unk> for the brave effort that was able to save his house.
The kindness that she watched over the other was that someone had reached even a pair of shoes.
And so much in my calling in Robin <unk> like in my calling as a firefighter I am witness to acts of generosity and kindness on a <unk> scale, but also of <unk> and courage to the individual level.
And you know what I've learned?
Everything has its importance.
So when I look at this room to people who have made, or they're by making them really remarkable levels of success I'd like to remind you about this: not wait.
Don't wait to win the first million to make the difference in someone's life.
If you have something to give, <unk> now.
<unk> food in a dining room, <unk> a park park.
are mentors.
Not every day we're going to have the opportunity to save someone's life, but every day we're going to be able to influence someone's life.
So <unk> <unk> <unk>
Thank you.
Bruno Giussani: Mark, comes back.
Mark <unk> Thank you.
This may seem <unk> but I'm a big fan of the concrete block of it.
The earliest concrete blocks built in <unk> with a very simple idea of cement from a fixed measure of a fixed measure of each other.
Very quickly, these became the largest building unit in the world.
They have allowed us to build bigger things that we, like buildings or bridges or bridges at the time.
Essentially, these blocks have become the pillars of our time.
Almost a hundred years later, in 1947, to <unk> it came up with this.
He called a brick of assembly itself.
And in a few years, the <unk> bricks came to all the home.
It's been estimated that over 400 billion or 75 <unk> per person on the planet.
You don't have to be an engineer to build more bridges or buildings or homes.
<unk> did it accessible.
<unk> I just embraced the concrete, <unk> in the world, and it became a fundamental piece of our imagination.
Meanwhile, exactly that same year, in the Bell Labs the next revolution was about to <unk> the new building block.
The transistor was a small unit of plastic that would take us from a aesthetic brick world, stacked around other to a world where everything was interactive.
Just like the concrete, the transistor allows it to create much greater and more complex circuits and more complex, a brick at the time.
But there's a difference. The transistor was just for experts.
I personally don't understand that the building blocks of our time are moving to the experts, so I decided to change it.
Eight years ago, when I was at the Media Lab, I started exploring the idea of bringing the power of engineers to the hands of artists and designers.
A few years ago, I started developing <unk>
I'm going to show you how they work.
<unk> are electronics.
They are <unk> to be light, sound, engines and sensors.
And the best thing for all is that they come together.
So you can't put it in the wrong way.
<unk> have a code of colors.
The green is the sun, the blue is the current, the pink and the pink input is the wire.
So you just have to assemble a blue with a green one, and very quickly you can start making older circuits.
A blue with a green one, produce light.
We can put a button in the medium, and then we have a <unk>
If we changed the button for a pulse, which is here, and now we have a <unk> light.
We put this <unk> to create more impact and have a machine machine.
I'm going to stop this.
So beyond the simple game, <unk> are actually very powerful.
Instead of having to program, connect and <unk> <unk> it allows us to program using very simple gestures very simple <unk>
In order to make <unk> faster, you just turn this button that makes the pulse faster or slower.
The idea behind <unk> is that it is a growing.
We want all interactions in the world to get to building ready to use.
<unk> sound, solar panels, <unk> everything must be accessible.
We have given kids to see them playing with them.
And it's been an incredible experience.
The best is how you start to understand the electronics of every day that you don't learn in schools.
For example, how it works a light from night, or why the door of an elevator is keeping it open, or how an iPod responds to touch.
We also took them to design schools.
So for example, designers without some electronics start playing with <unk> as a material.
You can see, with bottles of paper and <unk> we have <unk> <unk>
A few weeks ago, we took a few weeks ago, we took the designers at the Rhode Island School of Rhode Island that they don't have some of them in engineering, just in cardboard wood and paper and said, Make something.
So here is an example of a project that have done a <unk> cannon sheet for movement.
But wait, here's my favorite project.
It's a <unk> made of Play-Doh that is afraid of the dark.
For these no engineers, <unk> became another material, electronics became another material.
And we want this material to be at all.
So <unk> has open source.
You can visit the website, download all the design and design and <unk>
We want to encourage a world of creators, inventors and collaborators because this world we live in, this interactive world is ours.
So go ahead and make up.
Thank you.
Today I'm going to talk to you about unexpected discoveries.
I work in the solar technology.
And my little company is looking at getting involved with the environment.
<unk> collaboration.
This is a little clip of what we do.
<unk> Wait for a moment.
Can you take a little bit of <unk>
We can get better leave the video on the side of the side.
No.
This is not ...
All right.
The solar technology is ...
Oh, I would know the time?
All right. Thank you very much.
A couple of years ago, I launched an initiative to recruit the best designers and technicians to take a year and work in an environment that represents almost everything that is supposed to be, we asked them to work on government.
The initiative was called <unk> for <unk> and it would be like <unk> <unk>
<unk> some members every year and put them to work with <unk>
Instead of sending them to the Third World <unk>
They produced great <unk> worked with the <unk>
Their task is to show the possibilities of current technology.
<unk> <unk>
This is a <unk> from Boston.
So here it appears as if you look at a quote, but what you really look for is that someone will clean it when it comes out of snow because he knows it's not very good by turning fires when it's covered by a meter of snow.
How did it get to ask for help for this so <unk>
Last year in Boston, we had a team of members of <unk> for <unk>
They were there in February, and at that point, I would take a lot of last year.
They realized that the city never wiped out these <unk>
But one of the members named Erik <unk> I noticed something more more than the citizens <unk> with <unk> the sidewalks right in front of them.
So he did like any good programmer, I developed an app.
It's a nice app where you can take a <unk>
You take <unk> when you <unk>
When you do that, you put a name, in this case he got <unk>
If you don't, someone can be <unk>
I mean, it has a play component.
It's a modest app.
Maybe it's the smallest of the 21 apps last year.
But it does something that no other technology <unk>
And it goes into a viral way.
A responsible for systems of <unk> City, by looking at this app realized that I could use it not for the snow, but for citizens to get <unk>
It's very important to function of these <unk> of the tsunami -- but people are <unk>
So he asks the citizens to <unk>
And then Seattle decided to use it to make the citizens <unk> <unk> <unk>
And Chicago just got <unk> to make people <unk> to clean sidewalks when they were <unk>
So now we now know about nine cities that would use -- using it.
And this has been spread without <unk> green and natural way.
If you know a little bit of government technology, you know that this isn't usually happening.
The language of software typically takes a couple of years.
Last year in Boston, we had a team working on a project that took three people for two months.
It was a tool for the parents to choose the best public school for their children.
And then they told us that of being done by the normal channels would have taken at least two and side about two million dollars.
And that's not anything.
Now there's a project in the living power of California that until the moment has two million dollars and it doesn't work.
And there are projects like this in every level of government.
So an app that shows in a couple of days, and it spreads in a viral form is a kind of warning. to the institution of government.
It proposes the best way to work, not like in private companies like many people think that should be.
Also as a technological company, but more as the Internet itself.
I mean, without <unk> in the open way and <unk>
And that's important.
But the most important thing about this app is that it represents a way to address the question of the government that has the new <unk> not as a problem of an institution -- but as a problem of collective action.
And that's really good because it turns out we're really good for the collective action with digital technology.
And there is a very large community of people who are building the tools for them to connect together with efficacy.
And not only is it <unk> for <unk> but there are hundreds of people around the country that have been contributing to apps every day in their own communities.
They haven't been given to the government.
Do you feel a big frustration to that but they wouldn't be <unk>
And these people know something that we've lost from view.
And that is that if we leave the feelings of the politics, the row in the <unk> <unk> <unk> and all those other things that we give us crazy -- the government is essentially in words of Tim <unk> "What we do together because they were not <unk>
Now, a lot of people have abandoned the government.
If you are one of those people, I would ask you to do it because things are actually changing.
Politics is not <unk> the government itself.
And because the government ultimately <unk> -- remember that <unk> the <unk> the way it thought about how to produce change.
I didn't know a lot of government when I started this.
And as a lot of people thought that the government was to choose people to make them <unk>
Well, after two years I have come to the conclusion that the government is mostly about <unk>
This is the center of <unk> and information.
It's the place that calls the calls if you mark them <unk> in the United States.
Scott <unk> This phone call.
He joined the basis of official knowledge.
I found nothing. It started with animal control.
And he finally said, "Listen, you can open the door door to the house and make some strong music and see if they were <unk>
And it worked. So for Scott.
But that was not the end of the <unk>
Boston does not have a call center.
It has a <unk> and mobile and mobile phone call.
We don't have that app.
It was the work of very smart people from the Office of New York City <unk>
One day, this really happened to come up with this <unk> <unk> in my bucket of trash -- I don't know if it's dead.
How do I do for <unk>
<unk> dynamic is different.
Scott was talking in person.
In <unk> <unk> everything is public, so everybody can see this.
In this case, he saw it a neighbor.
The next report, like, "I went to the place, I found the bucket of trash behind the house.
<unk> Yes. <unk> Yes.
He brought the <unk> I went home.
Good nights, sweet <unk>
Pretty simple.
This is great. It's the confluence of the digital and the physical.
And it's also a great example of the income to the government to the distributed volunteer collaboration.
But it's also a great example of government like platform.
And here I don't necessarily mean the underlying technology definition.
I'm talking about a platform for people to be <unk> and help others.
So, a citizen helped another but the government had a key role.
It connected to the two people.
And it could be connected to the government services of being needed, but the neighbor is a better and more cheap alternative than the government services.
When a neighbor helps another, <unk> the communities.
If we call control of animals, that costs a lot of money.
One important thing that we have to think about the government is that it's not the same as political policy.
A lot of people do it, but they think that one is the input of the other.
That our entry for the government is the vote.
How many times have been chosen to a political leader, sometimes we spend a lot of energy to choose a new political leader and then we hope that the government will create our values and demand our needs, but we don't see changes.
That is because the government is like immense ocean and politics is the shallow <unk>
It's exactly what we call <unk>
And we say that word very much contempt.
But it's that <unk> what it is that holds that one thing that belongs to us that we funded as something that is working on our disease, that other thing, and a consequence is losing power.
People believe that politics is sexy.
If we want this institution to work, we'll have to make the bureaucracy sexy.
Because that's where the real work of government.
We have to collaborate with the machinery of government.
That makes the motion <unk>
They have <unk>
It's a group of citizens that have been writing a very detailed report on three <unk> pages in response to the <unk> <unk> of <unk> about the financial reform project.
That is not political activism -- it's activism <unk>
And for those of us who have <unk> to the government, it's time to ask us what world we want to leave with our children.
You have to see the enormous challenges that they have to face.
They really believe that we have to go without solving the institution that can act on the name of <unk>
We can't do without government, we need to be more effectively.
The good news is that with technology is possible to be able to rethink the function of government so that it can expand to civil society.
There's a generation that grew up with the Internet and knows that it's not so hard to act -- you just have to articulate systems in the right way.
The average age of our members is from 28 years, so I am a greater generation than many of them.
This is a generation that has grown up taking the word and giving that it almost for granted.
They're not giving that battle that we all face about who is going to be <unk> they're all going to talk.
You can express your opinions in any channel at the same time and they do.
So when you deal with the government problem doesn't really matter how much your voices.
They're using their hands.
They bring the work to work for apps that make apps better for the government.
And those apps allow us to use hands to improve our communities.
It can be wiping out a <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> a bucket garbage that has a <unk>
Of course, we could always have cleaned those <unk> and lots of people do.
But these apps are like <unk> <unk> that we're not just consumers -- we're not only consumers of government that we pay taxes and we get services.
We are more than that: we are citizens.
And we're not going to fix the government until we didn't get the <unk>
So I want to ask everybody, when it comes to the important things that we have to do together, all together, we're going to be a bunch of voices, or we're going to be a swarm of hands?
Thank you.
This is for me a real honor.
I've spent most of the time in prisons, prisons and death row.
I've spent most of my life in my life in developing projects and places where there's a lot of despair.
And I'm going to be here at TED watching and hearing these stimulus -- has given a lot of energy.
One of the things I've noticed in this short time, is that TED has identity.
And the things that tell you here have impact around the world.
On occasion, if something comes from TED, it has a sense and a force that wouldn't have a different way.
I say this because I think identity is <unk> important.
So here we've seen fantastic presentations.
And I think we've learned that the words of a professor can have a lot of sense, but if you look at feeling, they can have a special meaning.
A doctor can do good, <unk> if it's <unk> it can get a lot more.
So I want to talk about the power of identity.
I actually didn't learn this in the practice of the law, my job.
I learned from my grandmother.
I grew up at a traditional house of a <unk> family by a <unk> which was my grandmother.
It was hard -- it was strong, he had power.
It was the last word in the family.
She <unk> a lot of <unk> in our home.
It was the daughter of people who had been slaves.
His parents were born in slavery in Virginia <unk>
She was born on the <unk> and his experience with slavery <unk> the way it looked like the world.
She was hard, but he was also <unk>
When I was a little bit, and I looked at it, she came up with me and gave me a good hug.
I became so hard that I could barely breathe and then <unk>
One or two hours later, I went back to <unk> and I said, <unk> still feel my <unk>
And if I told him that no, I went back to me, and if I told him I know, I would leave me in peace.
He had this human quality that I would always wish to be near it.
The only problem is that I had 10 children.
My mother was the lowest of 10.
On occasion, when I was going to spend a time with it, it was not easy to capture their time and your attention.
My cousins were running everywhere.
I remember when I was eight -- nine years old, I woke up one morning, I went to the room, and there were all my cousins.
My grandmother was the other side of the room, and I looked at me.
I thought it was a game.
And then I looked at it and he said, but she was very serious.
After 15 or 20 minutes, she stood up, I went up, I got out of the room, and he said, "Go <unk>
I remember this as if it was yesterday.
I'll never forget it.
It took me outside and said, <unk> I will tell you something, but you can't say it to <unk>
I said, "All right, <unk>
She said, "Now <unk> <unk> I said, "Sure."
And I sat down, I looked at me and said, "I want you to know that I've been <unk>
And <unk> <unk> you're <unk>
He said, "I think you can do what you are."
I'll never forget it.
Then he said to me, and I want you to get three things, <unk>
I said, <unk> <unk>
And he said, "The first thing I want you to do, is you always want your mother."
<unk> "She is my <unk> and you have to <unk> that always <unk>
As I went to my mom, I said, "Yes, <unk> so I <unk> it.
Then he said to me, "The second thing I want you to do, is that you're always going to do the right thing, even though the right thing is <unk>
I thought, "Yes, <unk> I said, "Yes, <unk>
Then, finally he said, "The third thing I want you to call me is that I would never be <unk>
And I was nine years old, and I said, "Yes, <unk> I just will.
I grew up in the field, in the rural Side -- I have a brother a older year and a sister a year.
When I was 14, 15, one day my brother came home with a six <unk> I don't know where the <unk> took me to my sister and me and left for the woods.
We barely get to make the <unk>
He took a sip of beer, he gave my sister, she took a little bit and offered me to me.
I said, "No, no, no. It's okay. You know, you know, but I'm not going to take <unk>
My brother said, <unk> <unk> And you always do the same thing that we do.
I took something, your sister as well.
I said, "No. I wouldn't feel good at you.
Then my brother looked at me.
And he said, "What's wrong with a <unk>
He stepped down the <unk> and <unk> "Ah, not that you're still thinking about the conversation with <unk>
I said, "But what are you talking about?"
He said, <unk> tells all the grandchildren that are <unk>
I got <unk>
I have to admit something to you.
I'll tell you something I probably shouldn't say.
I know this is spreading <unk>
But I am 52 years old, and I can admit that I've never taken a drop of alcohol.
I don't say this is a <unk> I'm going to say it for the power who has identity.
When we create the right kind of identity, we say things to others who don't really make sense of it.
We can't get to do things that you don't think of being able to do.
I think my grandmother naturally believed that all his grandkids were special.
My grandfather had been imprisoned for <unk>
My uncles died of age-related <unk>
And these were the things that it is, according to it, we should have been <unk>
Now, trying to talk about our criminal justice system.
This country is very different from what was about 40 years ago.
In <unk> there were 300,000 prisoners.
There are 2.3 million.
In America, we have the largest incarceration rate in the world.
We have seven million people in parole.
And this mass <unk> in my opinion, has changed fundamentally our world.
In poor communities or black, it finds so much <unk> so much despair, for these facts.
One in three black men between 18 and 30 years is in prison or <unk>
In the urban <unk> of all the country, Los Angeles, Baltimore Washington, Washington, 50 to 60 to 60 percent of all the young people of color are in prison, or in parole.
Our system is not just distorted in front of race, it's also about poverty.
In this country we have a court system that is really much better if you're rich and <unk> that if you're poor and innocent them.
It's not <unk> but wealth causes the results.
And it seems that we feel very <unk>
The politics of fear and <unk> make us believe that these are not ours.
We're <unk>
It feels interesting.
We're looking at our work in our work some curious.
In my state, in Brazil as well as in other states, <unk> care of rights.
Right now, in Alabama, <unk> of the black male population has lost the right to vote.
And if we projected it to the next 10 years -- the level of loss of rights will be as high as it was before they were the law of the right vote.
We have this amazing silence.
I represent kids.
A lot of my clients are very young.
America is the only country in the world where he was inspired to age 13 years to die in prison.
We have in this prison country for kids, no possibility of getting out.
Right now, we're in the process of some <unk>
The only country in the world.
Ask people in death row.
This issue of death row is interesting.
In a certain sense, we've got to think that the final question is, people deserve to die by the <unk>
A very sensitive question.
But you can think about how we are in our identity.
There's another form of <unk> it's not about deciding whether people deserve to die for crime crimes, but if we deserve to kill.
This is interesting.
<unk> in America is defined by error.
On every nine <unk> people have identified one which is innocent that he is <unk> and liberated from death row.
A rate of mistake, <unk> an innocent for every nine.
This is interesting.
In aviation it would not be allowed to fly airplanes if every nine that would be, one would be <unk>
But somehow we get rid of the problem.
It's not our problem.
It's not our burden.
It's not our struggle.
I talk a lot about these things.
I'm talking about race and this issue of this issue of whether we deserve to kill.
It's interesting that in my classes with students in history -- I tell you about slavery story.
I'm talking about terror, the time that started at the end of the reconstruction of the reconstruction of the reconstruction of World War I.
We really don't know a lot about this.
But for the black Americans in this country, was a little defined by terror.
In many communities people were afraid to be <unk>
They were worried about being <unk>
The threat of terror was what they define their lives.
Now there are older people who come up to me and say, <unk> Stevenson, you tell you about -- you know, <unk> people who stop saying that in our history of the first time with terrorism, after <unk>
They ask me to say, "No, <unk> <unk> that we grew up with that."
The era of terrorism went on, of course, with segregation and decades of solutions and racial separation.
In this country we have a dynamic because we don't like to talk about our problems.
We don't like to talk about our story.
And that's why we haven't understood the meaning of what we've historically done.
All the time we will do with each other.
We create tensions and conflict.
It costs us to talk about races. I think it's because we're not willing to engage with a process of truth and reconciliation.
In South Africa, people understood that they could not overcome <unk> racial without a commitment to the truth and reconciliation.
In Rwanda, even before the genocide had this engagement, but in this country we haven't done it.
I was in Germany speaking about death row.
It was fascinating because one of the teachers stood after my presentation, and he said, "You know it's really disturbing you listening to what you are."
<unk> no death row in Germany.
We'll never be here."
The room stayed in silence and a lady said, "There's no way that with our story, we can never get into the systematic death of human beings.
It would be irrational that we, <unk> and <unk> we would put it to <unk>
<unk> about this.
How would we feel in a world where a nation like Germany, <unk> people, especially if they were mostly <unk>
We could not get it.
It would be irrational.
And yet there's this disconnection.
I think our identity is in danger.
If you really don't care about these hard issues, the positive and wonderful things are, however, <unk>
We love innovation.
We are fascinated by technology.
We love entertainment.
But lately, those realities are <unk> by suffering, abuse, <unk> <unk>
In my mind, we need to integrate the two things.
We talked about the need to have more hope, greater engagement, more engagement, more dedication with the basic challenges of life in this complex world.
I think that means to spend more time thinking and talking about the poor, those who never come to TED.
Think of them is, in some ways, something that's inside of our being.
It's true that we have to believe in issues that we haven't seen.
So we are. In spite of being so rational, so <unk>
That is with innovation, development is not only about brain ideas.
These things come from <unk> ideas also for the bottom of the heart.
This connection of mind with the heart is what drives us to look not just in the bright and <unk> but also in the dark and hard thing.
<unk> <unk> the great leader was talking about this.
He said, "When we were in Eastern Europe, suffering from <unk> we wanted all kinds of things, but primarily what we needed was hope, orientation for spirit, a will to be in places of despair and being <unk>
Well, that orientation for the spirit is practically at the heart of what I think, in communities like TED, must be <unk>
There is no disconnect with the technology and design, which will allow us to be truly human, if we don't pay attention to poverty -- to <unk> to inequality, for injustice.
Now I want to tell you that these thoughts make up a much more challenging identity than if we know these things.
We go back to <unk>
I had the great privilege -- being a very young lawyer from meeting Rosa <unk>
These women were used to just talk.
Occasionally, the lady <unk> was called me to say, <unk> come up to me to talk.
You want to come and <unk>
I said, "Yes, lady. I do."
So she said, "Well what are you going to do when you are."
I was <unk> <unk>
So I was just going and just <unk>
It was very <unk> very <unk>
And on one occasion I was there, listening to these <unk> and after a couple of hours, Ms. Parks went to me and said, "Now, <unk> I will tell you this idea of <unk> justice.
Tell me what you're trying to do."
And I started giving my speech.
I said, "Well, we're trying to question injustice.
We try to help those who have been <unk>
We try to confront prejudice and discrimination in the management of criminal justice.
We try to end up with the sentences for life, no freedom for the kids.
We try to do something about death row.
We try to reduce the population in prisons.
We try to end the <unk> <unk>
I gave it all my best speech, and eventually he looked at me and said, <unk> <unk> <unk>
And <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk>
At that point, Ms. <unk> got a finger in the face and said, "This is why you have to be very much, but very <unk>
I think that actually, the TED community has to be much more <unk>
We have to find the way to deal with those challenges, those problems, that suffering.
Because finally humanity depends on compassion for others.
I've learned some very simple things in my work.
I've been <unk> in things.
I have come to understand and believe that every one of us is superior to the worst than we have <unk>
I think that's true for everybody on the planet.
I'm convinced that if someone says a lie, it's not because it's a liar.
I'm sure if someone takes something that doesn't belong to you. It's not a <unk>
But even if someone kills another, it's not a <unk>
This is why I think there's a basic dignity in the people who must be <unk> by the law.
I also think that in many parts of this country and certainly in many parts of the world, the opposite of poverty is not wealth.
It's not.
I really think that in many parts of poverty is the justice.
And finally, I think that even though it is very beautiful, very beautiful, very <unk> we don't judge our technology, for our designs, or our rational capacity or rational capability.
At the end, it was <unk> the character of a society, not because of the way they deal with rich and powerful and <unk> but because of the way they deal with the poor, the <unk> the prisoners.
Because it's in this context as we start to understand really deep issues about what we are.
I'm going to feel <unk> I'm going to end up with a story.
Sometimes I do too much power.
<unk> tired, like everyone.
Sometimes those ideas go beyond my <unk> in an important way.
I've been representing these guys who've been <unk> with a lot of <unk>
I'm going to prison and I see my clients.
And I start to think, how can it be?
How can a judge turn to someone who isn't it?
The judge was <unk> as an adult, but I see a boy.
On a very late evening I was awake -- for God, if the judge can turn it into something that you don't are, must have magic powers.
Yeah, <unk> the judge has magic powers.
You should ask for some of that.
As I was very late, I couldn't think right, but I started working on a <unk>
He had a <unk> customer -- a small, black.
I started working on <unk> with a <unk> who said, <unk> for my <unk> black <unk> was treated as a <unk> <unk> <unk> of a <unk>
In the <unk> I put that there had been some <unk> behavior.
There was a <unk> line on how in this country there is no ethics, but a lack of ethics.
The next morning, I woke up thinking that <unk> <unk> would be a dream or really <unk>
For my horror, not just <unk> he had been sent to the cut.
It took about two months, I had forgotten it.
And eventually <unk> Oh God, I have to go to court for this case.
I got to the car, and I felt really <unk> <unk>
I went into the car court.
I thought this would be very hard and <unk>
I finally got out of the car. I went to court.
I was going down the stairs when I met a black black man, was the <unk> of court.
When he looked at me, he came up to me and said, "Who is you?"
I said, "I'm a <unk> he said, "That's you <unk> I said yes.
So I came up with me and <unk> me.
And I got to <unk> in the ear.
He said, "I'm proud of <unk>
I have to tell you now that that was <unk>
That was profoundly connected with my interior, with my identity with the capacity that we all have to contribute to the community with a vision of hope.
Well, I went into the TV room.
When I arrived, the judge looked at me.
And he said, <unk> Stevenson, you wrote this bold <unk>
I said, "Yes, Mr. <unk> And I went to go.
People started there. They were all <unk>
I was the one that had written those <unk>
They got the prosecutors the prosecutors the prosecutors the <unk>
Suddenly, without knowing how, the room was full of people. All right, because we talked about races, because we're talking about poverty, because we talked about inequality.
With the <unk> of the eye I got to see the <unk> that he was going to be <unk>
I would look at the window, and you would hear that <unk>
Let's walk down here and go there.
Finally, this old black <unk> with a concern, I went in the room and sat behind me, almost at the table of lawyers.
About 10 minutes later, the judge will be <unk>
For the break a <unk> I showed you upset because the <unk> had entered the room.
The assistant <unk> over the old black black.
And he said, <unk> what do you do in the <unk>
And the old black <unk> stood up, I looked at the <unk> and he looked at me and said, <unk> this young kid to tell this young woman who would keep his view on the goal.
I have come today at TED because I think many of you will understand that the moral arc of the universe is very big, but it folds towards justice.
That we cannot be truly human <unk> if we don't worry about human rights, and by dignity.
That our survival is linked to each other.
That our visions of technology, design entertainment and creativity must be <unk> to the <unk> <unk> and justice.
And above all, to those of the present you who share this, I just want to tell you to keep the view in the aim for <unk>
Thank you very much.
Chris Anderson: <unk> to hear and see an obvious desire for the audience, in this community, to help in your way, to do something.
Something not a check. What can we do?
<unk> There are several opportunities.
If you live in the state of California, for example, there will be a <unk> this spring in which it's going to make an effort to <unk> the funds that are actually spent on the political policies.
For example, here in California, are going to spend a billion dollars on death row, in the next five years. One billion dollars.
And despite this, the <unk> of murder cases, not <unk> in <unk>
<unk> of rapes are not at all.
Here's an opportunity for change.
This <unk> is going to come up with these funds to get the money to make the law, the law, for safety.
I think there's a very big opportunity.
CA: There's been a huge decline in <unk> in the United States in the last three decades.
Part of the explanation, it tells you that it has to do with the largest <unk> rate.
What would you say to you that you think is it?
<unk> Actually, <unk> rates with violence.
The vast growth in massive <unk> in this country is not for crimes with violence.
It's because of the wrong War on drug drugs.
That's why it comes up with this dramatic increase in <unk>
And we let us convince the rhetoric of the punishment.
We have three legal causes to bring people to the supply of <unk> to steal a bicycle, for small crime against their property, rather than making them <unk> those resources to their victims.
I think we have to do more to help victims of <unk> and not less.
It seems to me that our current philosophy about punishment doesn't do anything for anybody.
I think that's the orientation that has to change.
CA: <unk> have been excited about <unk> today.
You're very inspiring.
Thank you very much. Thank you.

Oh my God! Oh, my God!
And Peter <unk> These are just some of the clips that I got in the last six months. <unk> could be the last six days or the last six years.
The idea is that media means <unk> negative news, because our minds pay attention.
And that responds to a very good reason.
In every second of every day our senses get a lot more data than probably the brain can <unk>
And as nothing matters to us, the first stop of all those data is an old segment of the temporal lobe called <unk>
The amygdala is our early warning detector that the golden detector.
<unk> and records all the information looking for something in the environment that could be <unk>
That's why of a <unk> stories of <unk>
That old saying of the <unk> "If there is blood, <unk> is very true.
And because all digital devices give us the negative news, seven days of the week, 24 hours a day, no wonder that we are <unk>
It's no surprise that people think that the world will be wrong for worse.
But maybe not like that.
Maybe, instead, what really happens is we get <unk>
Maybe huge progress in the last century for a series of forces is <unk> so we have the potential to create a world of abundance in the next three decades.
I'm not saying that we don't have our good problems -- climate change -- the extinction species, the water shortage, and we have no doubts we have.
As humans, we are really good at <unk> the problems and the long time, we just had them.
And then we have happened in the last century to see where we go.
In the last hundred years, the average of life has more than <unk> higher per capita income.
Child mortality has reduced 10 times.
In addition to the cost of food, the cost of electricity, of transport and communications, has fallen from 10 to 1,000 times.
Steve <unk> showed us that we're living the most peaceful moment of human history.
And Charles <unk> that global literacy happened from 25 to more than 80 in the last 130 years.
We're really living an extraordinary time.
A lot of people did it.
And we have <unk> <unk>
In fact, <unk> the meaning of poverty.
<unk> today, most of the people who live under the poverty line have electricity, toilets, television, mobile TV, air conditioning and cars.
<unk> <unk> of the last century, the <unk> on the planet, would never have dreamed of such <unk>
And so much of this is the technology -- and lately, its exponential growth.
My good friend of Ray Kurzweil showed that any tool that has been <unk> in information technology jumps on this curve, Moore's Law, and doubling the performance of the price for about 12 to 24 months.
So the mobile phone that you have in your pocket is a million times cheaper and a thousand times faster than a supercomputer in the '70s.
Now look at this curve.
It's Moore's Law for the last hundred years.
I want you to look at two things on this curve.
First, the soft thing that is -- in good and bad times, in war and peace, in recession, depression and <unk>
It's the end of fast computers used to build faster computers.
It doesn't stop at any of the great challenges.
And even though it's <unk> on a law on the left, it curve goes down.
The growth rate of technology is actually faster.
And on this curve, on the Moore's Law, there's a series of extraordinarily powerful technologies that we have today.
The computation in the cloud, that my friends in <unk> are called ecological computing and sensors, 3D printing and their ability to democratize and distribute customized all over the planet, synthetic biology, and synthetic biology, the fuels and food, the vaccines and our food, the vaccines and the <unk> the <unk> and the <unk> and the <unk> the <unk> and the <unk> and the <unk> and the <unk> and the
I mean, how many saw the victory of the Watson, of <unk>
It was spade.
And I went to <unk> the best headline that I was going on.
And I loved this: <unk> <unk> to opponents <unk>
"Jeopardy" is not an easy game.
Play with the <unk> of human language.
Imagine this artificial intelligence on the cloud, which is available for every cell phone.
Four years ago, here at TED, Ray Kurzweil and I, we launched a new university called <unk> <unk>
We taught these technologies to our students, and in particular how they can use to solve the great challenges of humanity.
And every year we asked them to release a company, or a product or a service, which can really affect the lives of a billion people in a decade.
Think about that, the fact that a group of students can impact a life of a billion people.
Thirty years ago, that would have <unk> absurd.
Today we can point out a tool of companies that have already done.
When I think about plenty, abundance, it doesn't mean to create <unk> life for every single <unk> it's about creating a life of possible.
This is about taking that that is <unk> and making it <unk>
You see, scarcity is <unk> and technology is a force that releases resources.
I'll give you an example.
It's a story of Napoleon <unk>
He's the kind of left.
<unk> the king of <unk>
The troops of Napoleon ate with <unk> and the same <unk> with gold.
But the king of <unk> ate <unk>
You see, the aluminum was the most valuable metal on the planet, it was worth more than gold and <unk>
So the tip of the Washington Washington is about aluminum ...
You see, even though aluminum is the mass of the mass of the Earth, it doesn't come up as a pure metal line.
It's <unk> out of oxygen and <unk>
But then he got the <unk> and he made aluminum something so cheap that we use it as if it was <unk>
So let's take this analogy to the future.
Think about energy.
Ladies and gentlemen, we are on a planet -- for 5,000 times more energy than we use in a year.
They come to the Earth 16 <unk> of energy every 88 minutes.
It's not about need, it's <unk>
And there's good news.
This year, for the first time, the cost of solar energy in India is 50 percent less than the generated by <unk> <unk> rupees for 17 rupees.
The cost of solar energy dropped 50 percent last year.
Last month, the MIT published a study that shows that at the end of the decade, in the U.S. parts of the United States, the solar electricity will cost six cents the <unk> per hour compared to the 15 cents of the national average.
And if we have abundance of energy we also have abundance of water.
So let's talk about wars in the water.
Remember when Carl Sagan pointed at the Voyager spacecraft toward the Earth, in 1990, after <unk>
<unk> a big picture. How do you get <unk>
"A <unk> <unk>
Because we live on a planet. planet.
We live on a planet covered in 70 percent per water.
Yeah, <unk> is saltwater, water, two percent is ice, and we fought for the water <unk> but there's a hope.
It's an available technology not in 10 or 20 years, but right now.
It comes, the <unk>
In a conversation with Dean Kamen this morning, one of the innovators in the <unk> I would like to share with you, I gave you permission to <unk> your technology called <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> -- it's the size of a small walk.
It is able to generate 1,000 liters of drinking water to the day of any source of any source.
The president of Coca-Cola just is going to make an important test for hundreds of these units in the developing world.
If that comes out right, and I have full confidence that I can be, Coca-Cola is going to implement it in <unk> countries on the planet.
This is an ongoing innovation, for this technology that is today.
And we've seen it in mobile phones.
Oh my God, we're going to get to 70 percent penetration in the developing world for the end of 2013.
It was a better mobile communications warrior, in the midst of Kenya than the president Reagan 25 years ago.
And to tell with a smart phone with Google, has access to more knowledge and information than President Clinton 15 years ago.
She lives in a world of abundance of information and communications that nobody could have ever seen.
So better than that, the things that you and I have paid tens of thousands of dollars and hundreds of thousands of dollars -- video and libraries of books and music, technology of diagnostic diagnosis -- now <unk> and lose market value.
Maybe the best thing to get when it comes up with the health care.
Last month, I had the pleasure to announce with the <unk> Foundation, which is something called the X <unk>
We are challenging the teams of the world so that we can use these technologies in a mobile device that they speak, and because it has <unk> they can get rid of your finger.
To win it has to make better diagnostics than a certified doctor.
Imagine this device in the middle of the developing world where there's no doctors, where the burden of <unk> is 25 percent of the health workers.
When this device <unk> a RNA virus or DNA that doesn't allow us to call the <unk> and first of all, prevent the pandemic.
But this is the biggest force of producing a world of abundance.
I call it the <unk>
The white lines here are the population.
We just passed the mark of 7 billion.
By the way, the best protection against the demographic explosion is to give the world of education and health.
In 2010, we had less than two billion people online, connected.
By 2020, let's move from two billion to five billion users of the Internet.
Three billion minds have never been <unk> to the global conversation.
What will these people?
What would you do? What desires.
And instead of economic collapse, we will have the largest economic injection of history.
These people represent tens of billions of dollars in the global economy.
And more health care thanks to the <unk> of a better education with the Academy Khan and because of the use of traditional impressions and the cloud in the cloud will be more productive than ever before.
What can provide us three million more than humanity, healthy humanity, and <unk>
How about some voices never before <unk>
What if we give them to the Olympics, wherever they are, a voice to be heard, and they can act for the first time?
So what are these three billion?
And if you are contributions we can't be able to.
One thing that I learned with the X Prize, is that equipment for their passion with an objective goal, you can do things that were <unk> things that had only done the big corporations and the governments.
I'm going to end up sharing a story that really would be <unk>
There's a program that maybe some of you have heard of.
It's called <unk>
<unk> at the University of Washington, in Seattle.
It's a game where people can take a sequence of amino acids, and find out how the protein.
<unk> determine structure and functionality.
It's very important in medical research.
And so far, it was a problem of <unk>
They've played with this university professors, among others.
Then hundreds of thousands of people went together and started <unk>
And it has been demonstrated that today the machine recognition machinery is better folding proteins than the best computers.
Ladies and gentlemen, what gives me a huge confidence in the future is that we have more power to take the big challenges on the planet.
We have the tools with this exponential technology.
We have the <unk> of <unk>
We have the capital of <unk>
And we have three billion new minds that are <unk> to work on the solution of the great challenges and do what we should do.
We have for a few extraordinary decades.
Thank you.
I'm going to talk about a very exciting idea.
<unk> <unk>
And as the idea can be explained in a minute, before I give you three examples to do time.
The first story is about Charles Darwin, one of my heroes.
He was here, as you know, in <unk>
Maybe they believed that <unk> <unk> but it wasn't like that.
It actually <unk> fish.
And he described one of them as very <unk>
It was <unk>
He caught it up to the <unk>
Now the fish is in the Red <unk>
But we've heard this story a lot of times, over the Galapagos and other places, so that doesn't have anything special.
But the case is that we go to the Galapagos.
We still think they're <unk>
<unk> still say they're still <unk>
So what happens here?
The second story, also illustrates another concept.
Because I was there in <unk> studying one water in West Africa.
I was there, because I grew up in Europe, and then I wanted to work in Africa.
I thought it could be <unk>
It burned a lot with the sun and I was convinced that I was not there.
This is my first exposure to the sun.
The water was surrounded by <unk> and as you can see, from some <unk>
He had <unk> from about 20, the <unk> <unk>
And the fish of this <unk> was very abundant and spent for a good time, so it was made more than half in Ghana.
When I went there 27 years later, the number of fish had dropped to half.
<unk> to five centimeters <unk>
They <unk> a genetic pressure.
There was still fish.
In a way, they were still happy.
And the fish were still happy to be there.
I mean, nothing changed, but it all has changed.
My third story is that I was <unk> in the introduction of <unk> fishing in Southeast Asia.
In the 1970s in the 1970s started in <unk> Europe did a lot of development projects.
The fishing development meant to impose to the countries that already had 100,000 <unk> <unk> industrial fishing.
And this very bad boat, he called the <unk> four.
I went out to fishing in it, and we did studies in the south of the North China Sea, and mostly in the <unk> Sea.
What we captured was something <unk>
<unk> now I know, the bottom of the sea.
Ninety percent of what we capture was <unk> other animals that are in the background.
And most of the fish are <unk> tiny things about <unk> remains that are coral reefs.
In short, the sea background came to the deck and then it was <unk>
These images are extraordinary, because the transition is really fast.
In one year, you do a study and then start the commercial fishing.
The background is going to be a solid coral fund, in this case, to be a <unk>
This is a <unk> <unk>
Not <unk> <unk> because they were dead languages.
Once we captured a alive.
He was still not <unk>
So they wanted to take it because it was a good food.
This mountain of remains is what they collect the fishermen every time they go to an area that has never been the fish.
But there was no <unk>
<unk> the world, but we don't remember.
We put the start to start, the new level, without remembering what was there.
If you look at this something like that.
On the axis, and we have things called biodiversity, biodiversity, <unk> the <unk> of the country, the supply of water.
And that changes over time. It changes because people do things with <unk>
Every generation will use <unk> images at the beginning of its conscious life as the normal thing and extrapolate forward.
The difference is that they perceive loss.
But they don't perceive the loss that happened before.
You can analyze the kind of changes.
And at the end of keeping a few <unk> <unk>
And that is really what we want to do now.
We want to keep things that are no longer what they were gone.
But you should think that this problem affects people when poor societies kill animals without knowing what they have done until about generations later.
Because, of course, an animal which is very plentiful, before <unk> is <unk>
You don't lose animals.
You lose animals.
Even if this isn't perceived as a great loss.
Over time, we focus on big animals, and in a synonymous sea of large fish.
They become <unk> because the <unk>
At the time there are a few fish, but we think that's the point of <unk>
And the question is, why do we accept this?
Well, because we don't know it was different.
In fact, a lot of people, scientists, <unk> that was very different.
And they will do it because the evidence presented in a previous way is not the way they would expect that the evidence.
For example, the anecdote that some of us <unk> like Captain such as Captain as a lot of fish in this area can't be used or usually they don't use the scientists in the fishing, because it's not <unk>
So we have a situation where people don't know the past, even though we lived in societies, because they don't rely on the sources of the past.
So the enormous role that can make a protected marine area.
Because with the marine protected areas, we actually recreated the past.
It would take the past that people can't conceive of because the starting point has been run and extremely low.
That's for the people who can see a marine protected zone, and they can benefit from the vision that we can erase their <unk>
And what about the people who can't do it because they have no access, like the Middle East, for example?
I think there are the arts and cinema maybe they can fill the void.
This is a simulation of the Bay Bay simulation of it.
A long time ago, there was gray whales in the Bay Bay years ago.
And you will have noticed that <unk> and <unk> are like <unk>
And if you think about <unk> if you think about what people were moved with the movie <unk> to talk about the story of <unk> why they were <unk>
Because it raises something that in some sense, has been lost.
So my <unk> the only one that giving, is to Cameron, <unk> <unk>
Thank you very much.
Hello. I'm Kevin <unk> the <unk> <unk> and I look at YouTube videos in a professional way.
It's true.
So today we're going to see what the videos are made, and how important it has that.
We all want to be <unk> <unk> <unk> When I was younger, that seemed something very, very hard.
But today the web video makes any of us, or our actions, copper -- in a part of our world's culture.
Any one can be done by the Internet in a <unk>
They climb over 48 hours of video to YouTube for a minute.
And of those, just a small percentage of it, it gets lots and lots and lots of visits and <unk>
How does that happen?
Three things: Three things: Three things: <unk> communities and surprise.
Well, <unk>
<unk> <unk> Oh my God, God God.
Oh, my God!
Wow.
<unk> <unk>
KA: Last year, <unk> <unk> published this video out of his house in the National Park.
In 2010, it was 23 million times.
This graph shows the covers in the amount of popularity last summer.
<unk> not to do a viral video.
I just wanted to share a double rainbow.
That's what you do if it's called <unk> Mountain <unk>
There were many videos of nature.
This video had been published in January.
So what happened here?
It was Jimmy <unk>
Jimmy <unk> published this tweet that I would call the video to the popular.
The creators of trends like Jimmy <unk> we present new and interesting things and <unk> them to a wider audience.
Rebecca <unk>  He's Friday, Friday. You have to start on Friday.   Everyone wants me to get the end of the week, the weekend.   <unk> Friday, <unk> on Friday.  KA: You won't have this conversation without talking about this video, I hope.
<unk> de Rebecca is one of the most popular videos of the year.
You saw it almost 200 million times this year.
This chart shows the frequency frequency of use.
Just like <unk> <unk> this video seemed to have emerged from nothing.
So what happened this day?
Well, it was Friday, it's true.
And if you ask those other <unk> they're also Friday.
But what happened this day, this particular <unk>
Well, I took it <unk> and lots of blogs started writing about it.
Michael J. <unk> <unk> Science was one of the first people to do a joke about the video on Twitter.
But the important thing is that one person or a group of trends will take a point of view, and they share it with a broader public accelerating the process.
So this community of people who shares this great internal joke then starts to talk about that and do things.
And now there's 10 <unk> <unk> on YouTube.
In the first seven days, there was a parody for each of the other days.
Unlike the <unk> entertainment, of the 20th century, this communal involvement is our way to be part of the <unk> phenomenon, or doing something new with <unk>
<unk> <unk> is an animation animation.
So that's it.
This year was about 50 million times.
And if you think that's rare to know that there's a version of three hours that has been seen by four million times.
Even the cats saw this video.
And there are cats that saw other cats watching the video.
But the important thing here is the creativity that woke up between the Internet <unk> community.
There was <unk>
Somebody made an old version of the old one.
And then it became international did.
Suddenly, a whole community of <unk> that made this going to be a joke joke to something that we all can form a part.
Because today not just <unk> <unk>
Who could have predicted something like this?
Who might have predicted <unk> <unk> or Rebecca or <unk> <unk>
What wrong could it have been written by this situation?
In a world where you go up two video days per minute, just the only thing and unexpected it can be <unk> the way these things have done it.
When a friend of mine told me that I had to see this great video of a guy who had to do with <unk> <unk> in New York, I admit I didn't interested in too much.
Casey Casey <unk> <unk> <unk> but often there are obstacles that prevents you prevent properly by <unk>
KA: Thank the surprise and his humor -- Casey <unk> achieved that five million you see and understand her idea.
So this approach is worth the whole new thing that we make creative shape.
And all this leads to a great question.
<unk> <unk> What does this mean?
<unk>
KA: What does this mean?
<unk> communities are creative communities -- which are features of a new kind of media -- of a new culture, which we all have access and is the audience that defines the popular.
As I said before, one of the current celebrities in the world, Justin <unk> started YouTube.
They don't get permission to express your ideas.
Now we're all a little owners of our pop culture.
These are not the characteristics of old media -- are just the current media, but they restore the entertainment of the future.
Thank you.
This is not a <unk> story.
It's a puzzle that is still <unk>
Let me tell you about some of the parts.
Imagine the first <unk> a man burning the work of a whole life.
It's a poet, a <unk> a man whose entire life, had been supported by the only one and freedom of his country.
<unk> while the <unk> come into <unk> <unk> the fact that their life had been entirely on vain.
The words, for so much time friends, now <unk>
It was <unk> in silence.
He died completely <unk>
He's my grandfather.
I never met it.
But our lives are much more than our memories.
My grandmother never allowed me to forget his story.
My task was not to let that have been in <unk> and my lesson was to learn that the story tried to be <unk> but I <unk>
The next part of the puzzle is about a boat at dawn <unk> <unk>
My mother, <unk> I was only 18 years old when his father died, and marriage <unk> and two young girls.
For her, life had been meant to a task -- the escape.
It was <unk> for her that I could not do it.
And after a <unk> <unk> <unk> a boat has slid into the sea dressed in <unk>
All adults knew the risks.
The biggest fear were the hacks, rape and death.
As most of the adults, my mother was wearing a <unk>
If we get older, we first would take it to my sister and me, and then she and my grandmother.
My first memories are from that boat, the constant rates of engine, the <unk> diving in every wave, and the vast horizon.
I don't remember the hackers who came several times, but they were fooled with the bravery of men in our boat, or the engine dying and not be able to take for six hours.
But I can remember the lights in the oil platform in front of Malaysia, and the young man who collapsed and eventually end the journey was too much to it; and the first apple I tried, given for the men of the platform.
No apple had the same <unk>
After three months in a refugee camp.
And the next piece of the puzzle is about four generations to the course of three generations, shaping a new life.
We set up in <unk> a suburb <unk> that population is comprised of immigrant
Unlike the middle class suburbs whose existence <unk> in <unk> no sense of the right.
The smells that came from the stores were from the rest of the world.
And the English piece of English is <unk> among people who had one thing in common: they were beginning again.
My mother worked in farms, then on a assembly line of cars, working six days <unk>
Yet, I found time to study English and get a title in IT <unk> of <unk>
We were poor.
All the dollars were <unk> and established an extra mentoring in English and mathematics, you wouldn't care what is supposed to be <unk> who generally was <unk>
Two school pairs for school, one to hide the holes from the other.
A school uniform to the <unk> because I had to last six years old.
And there was a rare <unk> and <unk> about <unk> <unk> and some <unk> <unk> <unk>
At home, where?
Something is <unk>
I was accumulating and a voice who said, "I'm going to <unk>
My mother, my sister and my sister in the same bed.
My mother was <unk> every night, but we were terrified about our day and <unk> the movements of our grandmother.
My mother suffered <unk> all of the ship.
And my task was to be awake until his nightmares were started to be able to get it.
She opened a computer store, then studied to be <unk> and opened another business.
And the women came up with their stories about men who were not able to do the smelled and angry and <unk> and <unk>
They went to subsidies and grew up.
And it was created centers.
I lived in worlds parallel.
In one, it was the student <unk> <unk> with what I was going to do for myself.
On the other hand, I was <unk> in lives of life, Natasha <unk> by violence, drug abuse and insulation.
But many of them were going to come through the years.
And for that work, when I studied my last year of lawyer -- I chose the young Australian young man.
And I was <unk> from one piece of the puzzle to the other, but its edges didn't exist.
As <unk> a <unk> <unk> was now as <unk> refugee and social activist who were invited to speak in sites that had never heard -- and in homes that had never ever imagined.
I didn't know the <unk>
I didn't know how to use <unk>
I didn't know how to talk about wine.
I didn't know how to talk about anything.
I wanted to retreat into the <unk> and the comfort of life in an suburb -- a grandmother, a mother and two daughters end the day as they did for almost 20 years, <unk> on the day of every one and <unk> <unk> the three still in the same bed.
And I told my mom I couldn't do it.
It reminded me that I was now the same age that she had when she got to the ship.
The "no" had never been an option.
<unk> he said, "What won't be <unk>
So I talked about <unk> juvenile and education, and <unk> to the marginalized and <unk>
And the more frankly I talked about it was <unk> to talk.
I met people from all the lives of life, many of them doing what they were working on in the border of possible.
And although I finished my <unk> I realized I could not stay on a research race.
There had to be another piece of the puzzle.
And I realized at the same time that is going to be an unknown, a newly <unk> new thing on the scene -- and not only it's all right, but it's something that is going to be grateful, maybe a gift of ship.
Because being inside it can easily mean <unk> <unk> can easily mean accepting the assumptions of your <unk>
And I gave the enough steps out of my comfort zone to know that, yes, the world is <unk> but not the way we fear it.
<unk> that had not been <unk> they were <unk> tremendously.
There was an energy there, an optimism <unk> a rare mixture of humility and <unk>
So I kept my intuition.
They went to a small group of people who the motto can't be able to <unk> it was a <unk> challenge.
For a year we didn't have a <unk>
At the end of every day, I made a giant pot of soup that all of us <unk>
<unk> up to the night.
Most of our ideas were mad, but some bright ones, and we opened up.
He made the decision to move to the United States.
After a single journey.
My <unk> again.
Three months later, I had <unk> and the adventure <unk>
Before I finish, let me tell you about my grandmother.
She grew up in a time where the <unk> was the social norm and the local <unk> was the person who cared.
Life had not changed for centuries.
His father died shortly after she was born.
The mother was raised alone.
The 17 became <unk> from a <unk> whose mother <unk>
With no support of his husband, caused an <unk> to <unk> and to take the cause her, and much more <unk> caused when I won when I won it.
He can't make it wrong.
I was in the shower in the room in a hotel where she died, when she died, he was <unk>
I looked at it through the <unk> in the shower and I saw the other side.
I knew I had been <unk>
My mother called a few minutes later.
Days later, we went to a Buddhist temple, in <unk> and we sat around his <unk>
We tell the stories and make sure that we were still with it.
On the night a monk came and told us that I had to close the <unk>
My mother asked us to hold his hand.
I asked the <unk> "Why his hand is hot, and the rest of the body.
"Because you have taken your hand from the <unk> he said.
They haven't been <unk>
If there's a nerve in our family, that runs through women.
Because those of us and how life we built us up, we can now see that the men that had come to our lives would have been <unk>
The defeat had <unk>
Now I want to have my own kids, and I wonder about the ship.
Who could I wish that for yeah?
But I'm afraid of the privilege of the easy thing.
I can give you a <unk> in your life, <unk> brave in every wave, the <unk> rate of engine, the vast horizon.
I don't know.
But if I could give it to a secure and to make it safe would do it.
<unk> <unk> and also the mother of this is now in the fourth or fifth line.
My story begins in <unk> about two years ago.
I was in the desert, in the <unk> sky.
We were a conversation about how nothing changed since the age of former Indian <unk> "The <unk>
In those days when the Indians wanted to travel <unk> to a car and run the sky.
Now we do it with airplanes.
At that time when the great prince <unk> the great term Indian, I was <unk> I was taking a bow and a <unk> on the floor, he got water.
Now we do the same with <unk> and machines.
The conclusion that we took was that the machinery had replaced the magic.
And that <unk> me.
Every time I felt a little bit more than <unk>
And so I would love this idea of losing the ability to enjoy and appreciate a frog if I didn't have the camera -- if I could not hold my friends.
It seemed like the technology had to allow the magic, not <unk>
As a girl, my grandfather gave me his silver <unk>
And this piece of technology in 50 years was for my most magical thing.
It became a golden door to a world full of <unk> and <unk> in my imagination.
I had the feeling that mobile <unk> the luxury clocks and the cameras prevent it out.
Ask our inspiration.
So I was dumped by this technological world to see how we use it to create magic, rather than <unk>
I took books from the 16 years.
So when I saw the iPad I saw a narrative device that is able to connect the readership of the world.
You can know how we took the book.
Where we are.
We bring the text with the image, and the animation, sound and touch.
<unk> becomes more and more <unk>
But what do you do?
I'm about to launch an interactive app for the iPad.
He says, <unk> your fingers on each light."
And so ...  He says, "This box is <unk> I write my name.
And so I got a character of the book.
In several times, I got a <unk> -- the iPad knows where I live through the GPS -- that comes to me.
My inner girl are excited about all these possibilities.
I've talked a lot about magic.
And I don't refer to wizards and dragons to that magic of childhood, to those ideas that are <unk>
For some reason, fireflies in a jar were always exciting.
So here, we have to shift the iPad to release firefly
And of course, they light your way into the rest of the book.
Another idea that I was fascinated by a girl was that a whole galaxy in a <unk>
So here, every book and every world turns into a <unk> that I went to this magic device inside the device.
And this opens a map.
In the whole book of fantasy has always been maps, but they have been static.
This is a map that goes up, <unk> and you guide you for the rest of the book.
In certain points of the book also <unk>
Now I'm going to go in.
Another very important aspect for me is to create Indian content and the contemporary of contemporary <unk>
These are the <unk>
We all heard of <unk> and the <unk> but how many people out of India know their counterparts <unk> <unk>
These poor <unk> have been trapped in the cameras of Indra for millennia, in an old and <unk> book.
So we're bringing them back in a children's story.
In a story that's current issues like environmental crisis.
And talking about the environmental crisis, one of the problems in the last 10 years has been that kids have been <unk> attached to their <unk> they have not gone to the outside world.
But now with mobile technology, we can take our kids into the natural world with their technology.
One of the interactions of the book is this adventure where you have to go out the outside, take the camera or the iPad, and collect images of different natural objects.
As a girl, I had a lot of <unk> <unk> stones, <unk> and <unk>
For some reason they don't do it.
So to regain this childhood ritual that we have to go out and in a chapter -- it took a picture of a flower and then <unk>
In another chapter, you have to take a picture of a piece of <unk> and then <unk>
So this way is a digital collection of photos that then you can put on the Web.
A little boy from London puts a picture of a <unk> and he says, "Oh, I saw this <unk>
A kid in India says, "I saw a <unk>
And it creates this kind of social network around a collection of digital photos that have been taking.
Within the variants of connection between magic, the Earth and technology there are lots of possibilities.
In the next book, we got an interaction where you go out with the iPad and the video on, and using an augmented reality of a <unk> <unk> group that appear on the inside of the house.
At a moment the screen is full of leaves here.
And you have to make the sound of the wind and <unk> to be able to read the rest of the book.
We're going to a world where the forces of nature are <unk> with technology and magic and technology come closer to each other.
It will take the energy from the sun.
We're approaching our children and ourselves to us to the natural world, and that magic, joy and childhood love, that we sit through a simple story.
Thank you.
I'd like to talk to you about why a lot of <unk> projects.
And I think, really, that the most important thing is that we stopped listening to patients.
And one of the things that we did at the University of the University -- it was <unk> to a Mac of listening.
And not in a very scientific way, she raised a little cup of coffee or you and asked patients, family and <unk> what do you do?"
How can we <unk>
And we used to think, that this is one of the biggest problems for what everyone, or maybe not all, but most of the projects of <unk> they are actually keeping away from listening.
This is my Wi-Fi scale -- it's something very easy.
It has a doorknob and closed down.
Every morning <unk> me.
And yes, I have a challenge as you can see.
I got the challenge of getting to 95 <unk>
But it's so simple, that every time I get to <unk> you send my information to Google <unk>
And my doctor <unk> has access to him as well. So he can see what my weight problem is not at the same time where I needed to be <unk> or some urgency of that style -- but look at it backwards.
But there's another thing.
As some of you you know, I have more than a few of you that I have more than a few of you that I have more than some of you.
So every morning I connect to my scale and Wi-Fi and before I go up to my car, people start with <unk> today, I think you need a light <unk>
That's the best thing that can happen, because it's pressure of the pairs used to help patients, because it could be used for obesity, and also for patients stop smoking.
On the other hand, it can be <unk> to move the people from their chairs and together develop some <unk> activity to have more control of their health.
From the next week it's going to be available.
This little <unk> is connected to an iPhone or another device.
And people were <unk> from their houses, take their pressure pressure, <unk> their doctor, and share them with others, for example, for 100 dollars.
This is the point where patients assume a position, they return to regain control and to be captains of their own <unk> but it can help us health care because of the challenges we face as the firing of the attention costs -- the <unk> of demand and other issues.
We have techniques that are simple to use and start with this to engage patients in the team.
And they can do it with techniques like these, but also through <unk>
And one of the things we did like to share with you with a video with you.
We all have navigation navigation in <unk>
We may even have them in our phones.
We know it perfectly where ATM ATMs in <unk>
So where are all the <unk>
And of course, we can find strings of fast food.
But where is the closest <unk> to help this patient?
We asked, but no one <unk>
Nobody knew where to get the <unk> saves lives at this moment.
So what we did was we do <unk> in the Netherlands <unk>
We created a website, and we asked the public public -- you see a <unk> for <unk> <unk> where, and when it's open -- because sometimes it comes open in the office and others are closed.
And over 10 <unk> <unk> they were introduced in the Netherlands.
The next step was to look for the app for that.
And we made an app for the iPad.
We created an app for <unk> reality to find these <unk>
And every time you're in the city of <unk> and somebody else -- you can use your iPhone, and the next weeks use their phone phone to find the nearest <unk> to find the nearest <unk> which can save lives.
And from today, I would like to present this one, not just like <unk> <unk> which is the name of the product, but also like <unk>
And we want to take care of the world.
We are <unk> all the colleagues in the world, at other universities, so that we will help us find and work and act as a center for the <unk> of <unk> around the world.
Every time you're on holidays and someone <unk> can be a relative or somebody in front of you, you can find it.
I also want to invite companies around the world that could help us verify these <unk>
They might be services services, or people of <unk> for example, to see if the <unk> that shows is still in their place.
Please, <unk> in this and not just improve health, but take control of it.
Thank you very much.
I'm here to share <unk> <unk>
Or is it <unk> <unk>
Because, of course, it's photographs that cannot take with their cameras.
My interest in photography was woke up with my first digital camera at the age of 15 years.
I mixed with my final passion for the drawing but it was a little bit different because by using the camera the process was in planning.
And when you take a photograph with a camera -- the process ends when the <unk>
For me the photograph was more than to do with being in the right place at the right time.
It seemed like anybody could do it.
So I wanted to create something different, a process that would start with the <unk>
<unk> like this: A building on a very small road <unk>
But it has an unexpected turn.
And despite it, it keeps a level of <unk>
Or these pictures like dark <unk> dark and colorful in the time, but with the common goal of keeping the level of <unk>
And when I say <unk> I say <unk>
Because, of course, it's not something that I can do, but I always want it to have been captured in some way as photography.
So let me just have to think of a moment to find the trick.
It's more to take an idea that will capture a moment.
But what is the trick that makes it seem true.
They're the details or the <unk>
<unk> light?
So what creates <unk>
Sometimes illusion is perspective.
But at the end, it is about our way to interpret the world and how you can perceive it on a <unk> surface.
It's really not about whether it's realistic but what we think is realistic.
So I think the foundations are very simple.
I see it as a puzzle of reality that we take different pieces of reality and put them together to create an alternative reality.
I'll show you a simple example.
Here's three perfectly <unk> things that we can all relate to the three-dimensional world.
But combined in some way can create something that still seems to be <unk> as if there.
But at the same time, we know that it doesn't exist.
So let's look at the brain, because the brain doesn't embrace the fact that it really doesn't make sense.
And I see the same process by combining the pictures.
It's really in combining different realities.
And the things that make a picture look like if I think it's those in the ones that we don't even know about the things that are around us in our daily life.
But by combining pictures is very important, because otherwise something will look bad.
So I would like to say that there are three simple rules that will follow to achieve realistic.
As you can see, these images are not very special.
But <unk> can create something like this.
So the first rule is that the combination of pictures must have the same perspective.
Secondly, the <unk> photos have to have the same kind of light.
And these two images have these <unk> they were taken at the same height and the same kind of light.
The third point is to do impossible to distinguish the beginning and the end of the different images with a perfect marriage.
It has to be impossible to see where the image.
Here's another example.
You might think that this is the picture of a landscape and the bottom is <unk>
But this picture is totally comprised of photographs of different places.
I think it's easier to create a place that would find it because you don't need to put in danger the ideas that have in your head.
But it requires a lot of planning.
And as I thought about this idea in winter I knew that I had several months to figure out to find the different locations for the pieces of the puzzle.
For example, the fish was captured in a fishing journey.
The shores are a different location.
The <unk> was captured in a <unk>
And yes, even <unk> the house of the top of the island to be more <unk>
So to get a realistic outcome, I think it needs to be planning.
It's always starting with an idea.
Then we have to combine the different pictures.
And here every piece is very well <unk>
If you do a good job when you take the pictures that you take the pictures can be really beautiful, and the very realistic.
All the tools are there, and the only limit is our imagination.
Thank you.
I'm going to start showing a slide about technology, very boring.
Please, if you can get it wrong.
It's a <unk> diagram that I took from a folder mine.
I'm not so interested in that I'm going to show you all the details -- but the general shape.
This is an analysis that we were doing about the power of <unk> <unk> versus the power of local area.
The interesting thing about this is that this one, like many other that we often see, is a kind of a straight line on a <unk>
In other words, every step here represents an order of magnitude on the scale of performance.
I'm going to talk about technology with <unk> curves -- it's something new.
Here's something strange.
And I'm just going to talk to you.
Please light the lights.
They got more intensity because I write about paper.
Why are we going to make technology <unk>
The answer is that if you draw them on a normal curve where you say, these are the years or some of the time, and this would be any measure of the technology that I would like to look at -- the diagram would look something ridiculous.
It would be something like this.
It doesn't say a lot.
But if you take it for example, some other technology, like transportation, on a <unk> curve. It would be very dumb, we would see a straight line.
But if something like this, it gives you a <unk> change.
If <unk> technology <unk> as fast as <unk> we could take a taxi taxi and be in Tokyo in 30 seconds.
But not go through that rhythm.
There is no precedent in the history of technological development of economic growth that every single few years advance orders of magnitude.
The question that I want to ask is -- looking at these curves -- we see that they don't keep forever.
It's not possible to hold this way as fast as it goes.
So let's get one of two things.
Or it's going to become a typical curve -- I know how to come up with something completely different, or maybe I'll do something like that.
That's all that can happen.
I'm optimistic, so I think it might happen something like this.
So we would now be in the middle of a transition.
In this line we're in a transition from what used to be the world, to a new shape.
So what I'm trying to ask, and ask me, is, what is that new way that supports the world?
Why new state is the world?
The transition looks very, very confusing if we're engaged in it.
I remember the future happened in the year 2000, and people used to talk about what would happen in 2000.
This is a conference where people talk about the future, and we see the future remains 2000.
That's all we see.
In other words, the future has been <unk> year after year.
But I think it's because you feel something is going on.
That happens to be a transformation, and we can feel it.
And we know that it doesn't have a lot of sense to think about 30 or 50 years because everything will be so different that we extrapolate what we're doing today doesn't make any sense.
So I want to talk to you about how it might be, how could that transition you <unk>
But to do that will have to talk a little bit about things that don't have a lot to do with technology and computer technology.
Because I think the only way to understand it is taking distance and look at things in the long term.
The amount of time that I would like to do is the time of life on Earth.
I think this picture makes sense if we looked at each billion years.
So we go back about a half billion years when the Earth was a great rock that is a lot of chemicals that are <unk> around it.
If we look at the way that chemicals are organized with a sense of how things happened.
And I think there are theories to start understanding the origin of RNA. I'm going to tell you a simple version of this and is that, at that time, had been building some of the oil <unk> with all kinds of chemicals inside it.
Some of those oil drops had a particular combination of chemicals that gave them to bring out of the outside of the outside, and then drops grew up.
And they started <unk>
In a sense, those were the most <unk> cell forms -- those <unk> of oil.
But those drops weren't alive in the current sense, because every one of them contained a random recipe of chemicals.
And every time you get <unk> <unk> a <unk> distribution of chemicals that are <unk>
So every <unk> was a little different.
In fact, the drops that somehow will become better at the time to bring chemical chemicals -- <unk> more chemicals and more <unk>
They spend more time, more <unk>
It was a form of life, and chemistry, and very simple chemistry, but things are interesting when these drops learned the trick of abstraction.
In some way that we don't understand very well about these <unk> they learned to store information.
They learned to save information, which was the recipe for the cell, in a special chemist called DNA.
In other words, <unk> in this meaningless evolution, a system of writing that allowed them to record what they were in order to be able to <unk>
The incredible thing is that that writing system seems to have remained stable since that evolved two billion years ago.
Our recipe, our genes, has exactly the same code, that same writing system.
In fact, every living being is expressed with exactly the same set of letters and the same code.
And one of the things that I did just for <unk> we can write things with this code.
Here's 100 <unk> of white powder that try to hide the security security people.
But <unk> I took this <unk> The code has the common letters that we often use in this -- and I wrote my personal data on this piece of DNA and <unk> 10 to 22 times.
So if someone wants 100 million copies of my personal card, I have a lot for all the <unk> in fact, for every person in the world, and it's here.
If it was a <unk> I would have put it in a virus and would have spread over the room.
What was the next <unk>
Writing DNA was an interesting step.
This made these cells happily to be happy.
But then there was another great step in which things are very interesting in which things are very different and so that these cells began to exchange and communicate information forming the communities of cells.
I don't know if you know, but bacteria can exchange DNA.
In that way, for example, evolved antibiotic resistance.
Some bacteria found the way to avoid penicillin in the <unk> to create their little DNA with other bacteria and now there's a lot of resistant to penicillin because bacteria communicate.
This communication gave rise to the communities that in a way, they were together in that -- and a <unk>
So <unk> or <unk> together, or whether if a community was very successful all the individuals of that community would be <unk> by evolution.
And the turning point occurred when these communities came so much that, in fact, they came together so much, and they decided to write the entire recipe for the community board in a DNA chain.
The next interesting stage for life took another billion years old.
And at that stage, we have communities <unk> communities of many different kinds of cells working together as a single organism system.
In fact, we are a <unk> community.
We have a lot of cells that no longer act alone.
The skin cell doesn't serve without the heart, or the brain, or the brain, etc.
So these communities evolved and produced more interesting levels than the cell phone, something we call a organism organism.
The next level happened inside these communities.
And they started <unk> information.
And to build very special structures that were not doing more than process information in community.
It's <unk> structures.
The neurons are the devices that process the data that those communities built.
In fact, they started <unk> within the community being responsible for us to understand and convey the information.
Those were the brains and the nervous system in those communities.
And that gave them an evolutionary asset.
Because at that point, learning was confined to the length of an organism, and not the period of evolutionary time.
So one organism can, for example, learn not to eat some fruit because I knew bad and got sick the last time he ate it.
That could happen for the life of a organism because they had built these data processing structures that through evolution would have learned for hundreds of thousands of years by the death of individuals who ate that fruit of their fruit.
So the fact that the nervous system would build those information structures that we have changed the evolutionary process.
Because evolution could now happen by an individual.
It could happen in the time to learn.
But then, of course, the individuals discovered the trick of communication.
So for example, the most <unk> version we know is human language.
If we think about it, it's an incredible invention.
And I have a very complicated idea for a <unk> idea.
I'm sitting here emitting <unk> and hopefully building a similar idea, <unk> and <unk> in your heads that kept some analogy with my own.
But we take something very complicated -- it turns it into sound, in sound sequences and produce something very complicated in another brain.
That allows us to start working as a organism organism.
In fact, as humanity, we've started doing <unk>
We now went through periods of similar things to organisms and <unk> our crime methods.
For example, the invention of language was a little step in that direction.
The <unk> the computer tape, the <unk> and so forth, are the specialized mechanisms.
And that brings us into something much larger, faster and more quickly capable of evolving more than we did before.
Now evolution can happen in microseconds.
You saw the evolutionary <unk> of <unk> where it produced some evolution with the program <unk> in front of our eyes.
And now we have accelerated scales over time again.
The first stages of the history that I told you that took a billion years each.
The next few stages, the nervous system and the brain, took about hundreds of millions of years.
The decades and so on, they took less than a million years old.
And the next one, like electronics, seems to take just a few decades.
The process is <unk> I guess it's the right word to name something that speeds up its own pace of change.
The more changes, the faster it does.
And I think that's what we see in this explosion of the curve.
We see the process <unk>
But I make my life to design computers, and I know that the mechanisms that work for <unk> would not be possible without the recent arts.
But now design objects of such complexity that would be impossible for me in a conventional way.
I don't know that every transistor in that machine machine.
There are billions.
Instead, with the designers of <unk> <unk> we think of a level of abstraction, we put it in the machine, and the machine with that does something that you could not do, it gets much further and faster than ever before.
In fact, sometimes uses methods that we don't even understand well.
A particularly interesting method that I've been using lately, is evolution itself.
We put inside the machine an evolutionary process that operates at the scale of the microseconds.
And for example, at the most extreme cases, we can have evolved a program from a random sequence of instructions.
We say, "Please computer, you can run a hundred million sequences.
You could run these <unk> sequences at chance, running all those programs, and take those things that we want to do?"
In other words, I define what I want.
Let's say I want to give you numbers, to put a simple example.
So we find the programs that are closer to order numbers.
Of course, it's unlikely that some random sequences of instructions, <unk> numbers, so none of them did.
But one, luckily, he could find two numbers in the right order.
And I said, <unk> you could take 10 percent of those random sequences better than the <unk>
You know, those and <unk> the rest of it.
And now we <unk> the <unk>
And let's go through a process of analog <unk> to <unk>
Let's take a couple of programs, that <unk> kids, which <unk> <unk> and that kids will bring up the properties of both programs.
So we got a new generation of programs from the combinations of programs that had a little bit more successful.
And we say, "Please repeat <unk>
<unk> again.
They will bring some mutations in.
And it tries to move back to another generation.
Well, every generation takes a few milliseconds.
So I can do the equivalent of millions of years of evolution in a few minutes, or, in complicated, in a few hours.
In the end, we end up with programs that you hear numbers of so absolutely perfect.
In fact, they're much more efficient programs than I could have written by hand.
If I look at those programs I can't say how they work.
I've tried to analyze them to see how they work.
They're dark programs, strangers.
But they get <unk>
In fact, I know, I have the safety of that they get the goal, because they come from a bloodline of hundreds of thousands of programs that were able to do it.
In fact, their lives depend on it.
One time I went on a 747 with <unk> <unk> and he took a card and he says, "Look at this.
It says, <unk> plane has hundreds of thousands of <unk> who work together to offer a <unk> flight -- don't make you feel <unk>
We know that engineering processes don't work very well when they get complicated.
So we began to depend on computers to make new design processes.
And that allows us to produce much more complex things than the normal engineering.
We don't understand from all the choices that are there.
In that sense, it's in front of us.
We now use those programs to make computers much faster and so we can run these programs much more quickly.
I mean, it's <unk>
The thing goes more and faster, so I think it seems so <unk>
Because all of these technologies are <unk>
We're <unk>
And we are at a moment analog to the <unk> organisms.
We are the <unk> and we can't understand what the hell are we're creating.
We're at the turning point.
But I think that something comes behind us.
I think it would be very arrogant for us to think that we are the ultimate product of evolution.
And I think we are all part of the creation of whatever it is that come.
But now comes the lunch -- and I think it will stop here before I get <unk>
I think we have to do something with a part of the medical culture that must change.
And I think this starts with a doctor, and that's me.
And I've been spending time enough to afford to give a part of my false <unk>
Before I tried the theme of my talk, let's talk a little bit of baseball.
Why not?
We're near the end, the World <unk>
We love baseball, right?
baseball is full of surprising.
There are hundreds of statistics.
It's because of <unk> <unk> talks about statistics and use them to form a great baseball team.
I'm going to focus on one of them and hopefully a lot of you know.
It's called average <unk>
And we talked about 300 of a <unk> who <unk> 300.
That means the bat <unk> three of 10 times.
That means to throw the ball into the field of play without being <unk> and that anyone who tried to be <unk> to the first base of it, you don't get to time, and the second base will be <unk>
Three <unk>
You know how to call a <unk> of 300 in the Great <unk>
Well, really, well, maybe the team of stars.
You know how to call a baseball <unk>
By the way, that's somebody who from 10 <unk> hit four.
<unk> like legendary <unk> Williams, the last player in the League of the League of <unk> in running more 400 <unk>
Now let's get this to my world in medicine where I feel much more comfortable or maybe less awkward, after what I'm going to tell you today.
So suppose you have <unk> and they are <unk> a surgeon who has also a <unk> <unk>
It doesn't work, right?
Now suppose that they live in a place from and a dear to have two arteries <unk> <unk> and his family doctor brought it to a cardiologist whose world record in <unk> is <unk>
But do you know what?
She is going to take a lot of this year.
And their hits have been <unk>
This is not working.
But I will ask you to ask them.
What do you think of that must be the average of a heart or a heart surgeon, or a nurse or a <unk>
1,000, very well.
And the truth of the issue is that no one in all medicine knows the hits of a good surgeon, or a doctor or <unk>
So what we do, though, is the people in the world, and they included, to be perfect.
That would never, ever make a mistake and try to figure out how to do it well.
That was the message that <unk> when I was in medical school.
I was a student <unk>
Once, a fellow in high school said that Goldman Sachs was studied until for a blood <unk>
Just like that.
It was in my little <unk> at the General <unk> <unk> in Toronto, not far from here.
And I learned everything from memory.
From my kind of anatomy, <unk> the origin and the <unk> <unk> <unk>
And I even knew the <unk> diagnosis about how to classify <unk> <unk>
And as much more and more knowledge.
And I went very well; I graduated from <unk>
And <unk> from the medicine in medicine with the impression that if you were to get it out, then it would know everything, or the most possible thing to do, because this is how you get rid of the mistakes.
And it worked for a while, until I met the lady <unk>
I was a resident in a university hospital here, in Toronto when they brought the lady back to the emergency room where I worked.
At the time I was assigned to the service of <unk>
And when an emergency E.R. I was going to go to a cardiologist who touched that patient.
I report the chief of residents.
When I saw the lady <unk> I was <unk>
I heard a <unk> sound.
And when the <unk> I heard a <unk> sound in both sides, which was a heart failure.
In these conditions, the heart stops working and instead of pump the blood forward, the blood goes to our lungs, these are <unk> and so there's difficulty breathing.
And it wasn't hard for me.
I did it and I got to work on the treatment that I was going to get to.
I gave it <unk> and medication to alleviate pressure in their heart.
I gave it <unk> water pills so that I could eliminate liquid <unk>
And in an hour or two, she started feeling better.
And I felt very well.
And that's when I made the first <unk> I sent it to his house.
In fact, I made two more.
He sent her home without talking to the chief of residents.
I didn't hold the phone and I did what I should have done, I should be calling my boss and <unk> with him for <unk>
And if my boss would have seen it, would have been able to give information <unk>
Maybe I did it for a good reason.
Maybe I didn't want to be a <unk>
Maybe I wanted to be so successful and able to take <unk> that I could take care of my patients without even touch my boss.
The second mistake I made was worse.
When I sent it to his house, I didn't take a voice in my inside that she said, <unk> is not a good idea. I don't know.
In fact, he was so unsure that until I asked the nurse that I would give to the lady <unk> "Do you believe it's okay if you go to his <unk>
And the nurse thought and then he said, "Yes, I said, "Yes, I think it's okay.
I remember that as if it was yesterday.
And so he signed up the high and the ambulance together with the ambulance who took her home.
And I went back to the hospital.
The rest of that day, that afternoon, I had a bad <unk> in the stomach.
But I went on with my job.
At the end of the day, I went on to leave the hospital and walked into the parking lot where my car was going to go home. At that point, I did something I don't do normally, as well.
I went through the emergency emergency service service.
And there another nurse is that another nurse -- not the <unk> of the lady <unk> before, but another one told me three words, those three words that most of the emergency emergency doctors did.
Other specialists who fear also, but there's a <unk> in <unk> and it's that we see patients <unk>
The three words are: <unk>
<unk> of the patient who sent his <unk>
I asked the other nurse with total <unk>
They said, "You know, she <unk> the same tone of voice.
She was okay.
But I went back and at the edge of death.
After an hour of having came to his home, after I gave her my high school, he suffered a <unk> and his family called the <unk> on the emergency room with a <unk> <unk> of <unk> which means a shock of <unk>
I just just breathe and it was blue.
emergency staff, all their resources.
They gave him medication to raise pressure pressure.
And they put a <unk>
I was <unk> and <unk> to the core.
He had a mixture of feelings because after the <unk> was in intensive therapy and expected against every hope that they were <unk>
And in the two or three days old days was clear that I never did.
He had a permanent brain damage.
The family came together.
And in eight or nine days, they went to what was going on.
And in ninth day, he left her go. Mrs. wife, mother and grandmother.
They say they never forget the names of those who die.
That was my first experience.
The weeks next to me for that, and I felt for the first time, the <unk> shame that exists in our medical culture, and I sat down with no feeling that healthy shame because you can't deal with your colleagues.
You make peace and never make that mistake.
Is that shame that leaves a teaching.
<unk> shame that I talk about is that it makes us feel very badly <unk>
It's the thing that tells us not that what we did was wrong, but we're bad.
And that meant it.
And it wasn't for my <unk> he was a <unk>
I talked to the family and I'm sure that I did things and made sure I didn't get <unk>
And I kept those questions.
Why did I not ask my <unk> Why was he sent to his house?
And in my worst <unk> why I made a mistake so <unk>
Why did I choose medicine?
Little to that feeling was <unk>
And I started to feel better.
And in one day he opened the sky and finally went out the sun, and I wondered if I would feel better again.
And I made a deal with myself in which if I was paying the efforts to be perfect for not to make more mistakes, I could prevent those voices.
And it did.
I went back to work.
But it went back to happen.
Two years later, I was an NGO in the emergency department in a community hospital in a community hospital in Toronto, and I got a <unk> man.
I was really busy and <unk>
And he pointed up here.
I looked into her because he was a little <unk>
He sent it out of penicillin and sent it to his house.
But while he ran to the door was still pointing out his <unk>
Two days later, when I came to make my guard, my boss asked to talk to me in his office.
And I gave the three words: <unk>
Remember the patient who saw by a pain in <unk>
Well, he came back and he had no <unk>
He had a potentially mortal condition called <unk>
You can look at Google. It's an infection, not because it's the top, but the top Air goes on the top of those tracks.
He said, fortunately, she didn't die.
You get a <unk> antibiotics by the way it goes through, and they recovered to the few days.
And I went through the same period of shame and <unk> then I went back and went back to work, until it happened over and over again, and over again.
Two times in the same turn turn it not <unk> <unk>
And it's a great effort, especially working in a hospital, because it was <unk> 14 patients at the same time.
But in both cases, I didn't go home and I don't think it's been a <unk>
One of them thought I had a <unk> calculation of it.
And it turns out an X-ray of kidneys but it turns out, a colleague who was checking into the patient's patient, some sensitivity in the lower right corner and called the surgeon.
The other patient was with a lot of diarrhea.
She was liquid order to <unk> and I asked my colleague to do it."
I looked at it and looking at some sensitivity in the lower right quadrant, called the surgeon.
They were both operated and they recovered well.
But every single case was <unk> me.
But I would like to tell you that I made the worst mistakes in the first five years of exercise and so many colleagues say, is a <unk>
The most significant for the last five years.
<unk> embarrassed and <unk>
And here's the problem: If I can't get myself and talk about my mistakes, if I can't find the <unk> that tell me what really happens, how can I share this with my <unk>
How do I show you this to not make the same <unk>
If I would go back to a place like this, I would not have any idea of what you think about me.
When was the last time you heard somebody talk about failure, when he came to failure, after failure?
And of course, at a cocktail party to talk about the failures of other doctors, but you'll not hear someone to talk about their own mistakes.
And if I knew and my colleagues as well, as a <unk> in my hospital <unk> the wrong leg -- trust me, he would have difficulty looking at your eyes.
This is the system that we have.
The total denial of mistakes.
It's the system that there are two <unk> the system that you make mistakes and the ones who make mistakes that they can't sleep and the ones that I know; they have <unk> outcomes and the ones that have great results.
And it's almost like a <unk> reaction as an antibodies that begin to attack that person.
We have the idea that if you take care of medicine to the people who make mistakes.
But that brings two problems.
In 20 years of diffusion and training, and I have done a personal study of bad medical care and failures to learn how possible, from the first paper I wrote for the Toronto Trek to my <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
And what I learned is that mistakes are <unk>
We work in a system where errors happen every single day, where one of the 10 drugs are <unk> in the hospital are wrong, or <unk> is not correct. In a system where animal infections are increasingly and more <unk> causing chaos and death.
In this country, 24,000 <unk> die by criminal <unk>
The U.S. Institute set up to a 100,000.
In both cases, it's about <unk> <unk> because we're not <unk> the problem as we should.
And that's what things are.
A <unk> system where knowledge is multiplying every two or three years, and we don't get to <unk>
<unk> sleep is <unk>
And we can't get rid of it.
We have cognitive biases that allow a perfect history of a patient with pain on the chest.
Now, let's take the same patient with a chest pain -- it comes <unk> with <unk> eyes, and I breath out to alcohol, and all of a sudden, my story <unk> from contempt.
It's not the same story.
I'm not a <unk> I don't do things always the same.
And my patients are not cars. They didn't get their symptoms always in the same way.
So the mistakes are inevitable.
So if we take the system as we get away, and we remove all the professionals who will error, well, not leave anybody.
And with respect that people don't want to talk about their <unk>
In my <unk> <unk> white art, it's already a habit say, "This is my worst <unk> I would say to everyone, from the <unk> of surgery, <unk> <unk> blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah,
And his students <unk> <unk> to go down the head and <unk> saliva and start telling their stories.
They want to tell their stories, they want to share them.
You know, you can say, "Look, don't make the same <unk>
They need a context where we can do it.
They need a medical culture.
And it begins with a doctor every time.
<unk> doctor is human, they know human -- they accept it, and it's not proud of their mistakes, but it was trying to learn how that happened to teach others.
They put their experiences with them.
It's support for those who are talking about their mistakes.
<unk> the mistakes of other people not with intention of <unk> but in a loving way, and support for all of the <unk>
And it works in a medical culture that recognizes that human beings run the system and when this happens, they make mistakes in time.
My name is Brian <unk>
I'm a <unk> doctor.
I'm human <unk>
And I feel so much, but I strive to learn something that can convey to others.
I don't know what you think about me, but I can live with that.
And let me conclude with three words: <unk> I remember.
Do you know how many decisions we take a <unk>
Do you know how much we choose in a week per year.
So recently, I made a survey over 2,000 people and the average amount of choice that says to pick up an American American -- about 70 to the day.
Not long ago in a research went on a week to a group of presidents of companies.
The researchers recorded the different <unk> tasks.
They found that, on average, <unk> <unk> <unk>
Naturally, every job included many <unk>
Half of those decisions took nine minutes or so.
Only about 12 percent required an hour or more of his time.
Now think about your elections.
Do you know how many belong to the category of nine minutes, and how many of the <unk>
How is the way that it is driving those decisions?
Today I want to talk about one of the biggest problems of <unk> to choose the <unk>
I want to talk about the problem and about potential solutions.
As I talk about this, I'm going to ask you a few questions and I need to know your answers.
When I ask a question, like I'm blind, raise your hand just if you want to burn calories.
Another way, when you ask a question, if your answer is positive, please give a <unk>
And now my first question of the day, you're ready to hear about the problem of <unk>
Thank you.
Being a graduate student at the University of Stanford, <unk> this level of very <unk> at least at least in that era was very sophisticated.
It was called <unk>
It was almost like going to a <unk> park.
It was about 250 different kinds of mustard and <unk> over 500 different kinds of fruits and vegetables and about 25 of the water -- and this was when we took water from the tap.
I loved going to that store, but on one occasion, I said, "Why do I never buy nothing?
This is a <unk> oil.
They had over 75 different ways, including those who were in <unk> <unk> who came from trees.
I once decided to visit the manager and asked her, <unk> this strategy, all these <unk>
He pointed to the buses full of tourists who came every day, usually with their cameras.
We decided to make a little experiment with the <unk> This is the <unk>
hall.
They had different classes.
They took a <unk> <unk> right to the entrance.
We put it out there <unk> from six <unk> or 24 flavors and we're looking at two things: First of all, what people were willing to stop trying to test it.
More people stopped when I had <unk> a 60, that when there was only six, a 40.
We also look at what case they were more likely to buy a <unk>
Here's the opposite effect.
The ones that stopped when I had <unk> only three percent of them got to buy <unk>
If there was six, we saw that 30 percent bought <unk>
If we do the calculations, people had six times more likely to buy <unk> if they found six.
Well, to decide that we don't buy <unk> we probably are good at least good for <unk> but it turns out that the problem of the <unk> of choices affect us in <unk> decisions.
We decided to do not decide, even if this is not <unk>
Now the theme of the day, the environmental savings issue.
I'm going to tell you a study that I did with <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> where we're looking at the decisions on savings for about a million Americans, from about 650 plans of this country.
We were interested in to see if the number of <unk> available plans in their savings plans for retirement, the program <unk> to save for the future.
And we found that I really had a <unk>
We had <unk> plans that went from two, until 59 different choices.
We found that the bigger the number of funds -- there were fewer participation.
So if you look at the extreme, we see that in the plans that offer two <unk> the rate of participation was about 70 or more, not as high as I wanted to.
And in the plans that would offer a few <unk> the rate of participation landed on the '60s.
It turns out that even if you decide to participate, when there's more choice, even in that case, the negative consequences.
So for those who decided to participate, the bigger the number of choice, more people will be able to avoid actions.
As much as we would have more choice, they were more willing to invest in the financial accounts of market.
But none of these extreme decisions are the ones that we are trying to optimize the future financial well-being.
In the previous decade, we have seen three main negative consequences to offering more and more possibilities.
The most likely thing is that <unk> the decision that <unk> even when this is against self-interest.
They are more likely to take the worst decisions in the <unk>
They are more likely to pick up things less <unk> even though objectively they will get it better.
The main reason is that we were looking at that giant array of <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> but we are not able to do the calculations to compare to contrast and choose that remarkable <unk>
Today I want to give you four simple simple techniques that we have <unk> in one way or another, in different research, so you can test in their business.
The first is <unk>
You've heard before, but it's never been more than today, than today, less is more.
People always care when I say, <unk>
They care about losing space in the <unk>
But actually what we're looking at more and more is that if you decide to cut up, get rid of <unk> <unk> -- there is going to be an increase on the sales, you would have a better experience in the choice.
When <unk> & <unk> I went from 26 different types of <unk> & <unk> at 15, you saw a 10 percent increase in revenue.
When the Golden Gate corporation removed the products to feed them from cats who are less <unk> they raised <unk> in <unk> by two <unk> greater sales and smaller costs.
You know that today's promotion of today, have been 45,000 products.
In a Wal-Mart store, there's about 100,000 products.
But the ninth largest store in the current world is <unk> and it provides only 1,400 <unk> a kind of tomato tomato tomato tomato <unk>
In the world of the financial savings -- I think one of the best examples that have emerged about how to handle the choices is the question of David <unk> the Harvard program.
All the employees of Harvard are actually <unk> by a success of life.
The people who really want to choose a choice, not 300 or more.
They know that often people say, "I don't know how you are."
They are all options <unk>
The first thing I do is ask the <unk> <unk> the differences there are among those options.
And if your employees can't afford it, you don't have to make their <unk>
This afternoon, before I started this session, I was talking to <unk>
He told me that he would be willing to offer the people in this audience with a whole vacation of the world's world's <unk>
Here, a <unk>
I want you to read it.
I'm going to leave a few seconds to get it, and then I want you to take a applause if you're ready to take the offer of <unk>
<unk> <unk> Okay. Anyone who's ready to take the supply.
They're not more?
Well, I'm going to show you something else.
You knew there was a trick.
Who is ready for that <unk>
I think I really got to hear more hands.
All right.
In fact, you have more information in the first round, that in the second round, but I can tell you that the second time was more real.
Because the images made it look more real.
This brings me to the second technique to handle the problem of the <unk> of choices which is <unk>
For people to understand differences between choice, they have to understand the consequences of every choice, and that the consequences must be very specific in a very narrow way.
Why is people spend 15 to 30 percent more on average when they use debit cards, which when they use <unk>
Because it doesn't seem real money.
It turns out to make it look more real, can be a very positive tool for people to do more.
We did a study with <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> on <unk> <unk> who worked in <unk> these people were in a meeting where they were <unk> to a <unk> plan.
And at that meeting, that <unk> exactly as a little <unk> we did a little <unk>
So what we set up was that we would get to the staff who would think of the positive things that they were in their lives if they save more money.
With this <unk> there was an increase in the <unk> of 20 percent and an increase in the amount that they were interested in saving or what they wanted to put on their <unk> accounts.
The third technique is <unk>
We can handle more categories than options.
For example, this is a study that we did in a magazine hallway for example.
We saw that in supermarkets, <unk> throughout the corridor of <unk> the exhibit of magazines can contain from <unk> different kinds of <unk>
But you know?
Because the mechanism tells me how to <unk>
These are two pieces of <unk>
One is called <unk> and the other, <unk>
If you think the one on the left is <unk> and the one on the right is <unk> give you a <unk>
<unk> Well, there's a few of them.
If you think the one on the left is <unk> and the one on the right is <unk> give you a <unk>
Well, something else.
It turns out it's right.
The one on the left is <unk> and the one on the right is <unk> But you know what?
This rating framework is totally futile.
The categories must indicate something to the <unk> not when they were <unk>
You often see this problem with these huge lists of funding.
Who are they <unk>
My fourth <unk> <unk> complexity.
It turns out that we can handle much more information than what we think, if you just take it a little bit.
We have to increase the gradually.
I'm going to show you an example of what I want to say.
Let's look at a nice decision -- the purchase of a car.
This is a German manufacturer of cars that allow us to run out completely.
You have to take a <unk> to build the car.
And these decisions vary in the number of choices that offers each other.
<unk> <unk> <unk> I have 56 possibilities.
<unk> <unk> <unk>
So what I'm going to do is vary the order where the decisions.
So half of the clients are going to go from many choices, 56 colors, to just four boxes.
The other half of the clients will go from a few choices, four <unk> to 56 colors, a lot of options.
And what am I going to <unk>
How about you in <unk>
If you get <unk> always the default button in every decision, this indicates they're <unk> or <unk> we're <unk>
We found that the ones that go from many choices to <unk> <unk> the default button over and over again, and another more.
<unk>
If you go from a few choices to many, they continue there.
The same information, the same number of options.
The only thing that I did was to alter the order where the information.
If we started the easy thing, you learn to <unk>
Although the choice of the box box is not saying anything about preferences of interior, all of us are making us to choose.
We're excited about a product that we're building that now has more <unk> with the process.
So to sum up.
I've been talking about four techniques to mitigate the problem of the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> we can handle more categories on less <unk> <unk> complexity.
All of these techniques that I've been presented were designed to help handle <unk> or better, for you, in their own business, or for people who are going to work.
So I think the key to getting the best thing to get the best of a choice is to be careful to <unk>
And the more careful the more careful us are in our best choices we can practice the art of choice.
Thank you very much.
In the 1960s in East Germany, <unk> if you had a writing machine, it had to be <unk> to the government.
He had to record a <unk> sheet, written from the machine.
And this for the government could track the origin of the texts.
If you found a writing with the wrong message to the origin of the idea.
In the West we don't think that someone could do this, how much this would take the freedom of expression.
We would never do that in our countries.
But today, in 2011, if you buy a laser printer from any big manufacturer and print a page, that page will end up with a few yellow dots on every page that you get a pattern of one and your printer.
That is happening today.
And no one seems to be really much like this.
This is an example of the ways that our governments use technology against us, citizens.
And it's one of the three main causes of problems on the network.
If you look at what happens in the world online, we can put together the attacks according to their <unk>
There are three main groups.
Are you <unk>
As Mr. <unk> <unk> from the city of <unk> in Ukraine.
<unk> phone is very easy to understand.
These guys make money.
They use the <unk> to earn a lot of money, enormous numbers.
There are really many cases of <unk> online, <unk> that will take money with their attacks.
This is <unk> <unk> of <unk> <unk>
This is Alfred <unk>
This is Stephen <unk>
This is <unk> <unk>
These are Matthieu Anderson, <unk> <unk> etc., etc., etc.
These guys do their <unk> online, but they do it by illegal media by stealing money from our accounts when we buy in <unk> or steal our keys to get information from our cards, when we shop in a computer computer.
The secret <unk> in the United States -- two months ago, <unk> the Swiss account of this guy, Sam <unk> and this account was <unk> million dollars when it was frozen freezing.
Mr. <unk> It's <unk> you know her <unk>
And I say that today is more likely to be any of us than any of us from a <unk> than a real crime.
And it's very obvious that this is going for worse.
In the future, most crime crimes online.
The second group of <unk> in importance that we observe today is not driven by the money.
There is another thing that the moving, give them the protests, they motivate them to motivate you laughter.
Groups like Anonymous have <unk> in the last 12 months occupying a leading role in online attacks.
Those are the three <unk> <unk> the criminals who do it for money, the <unk> like Anonymous who do it to protest and the last group are the United States of the United States <unk>
And then we see cases like <unk>
That's a good example of government <unk>
<unk> is an <unk> authority of the Netherlands or, actually, it was.
<unk> the last fall, because of a <unk>
It was the safety of the site and carried a <unk>
I asked last week at a meeting with the Dutch government representatives asked one of the leaders if they were <unk> <unk> the death of people because of the attack to <unk>
And the answer of it was yes.
So how do people die of a <unk>
<unk> is a <unk> authority.
<unk> <unk>
Why are the <unk>
Well, you need to have a web website with <unk> services, <unk> services like <unk>
Except that <unk> a foreign authority.
And that <unk> <unk>
And in the case of <unk> exactly that.
And what happened in the Arab Spring, and those things that have happened, for example, in <unk>
Well, in Egypt, <unk> protesters the headquarters for the secret <unk> Egyptian police in April 2011, and during the building, they found a lot of papers.
Out of those papers was this folder called <unk>
And within that folder there was notes of a company based on Germany that had been in Germany that had sold the Egyptian government for <unk> the communication of the country.
They had sold this tool for 3,000 euros to the <unk> government.
The headquarters is right here.
I mean, Western governments give them the tools to the governments that have to do this to their citizens.
But Western governments are also doing this.
For example, in Germany, just a couple of weeks ago, I found <unk> <unk> a <unk> used by the German government to investigate their own citizens.
If you are <unk> in a criminal case -- it's pretty obvious that your phone is pretty obvious that your phone is <unk>
But today it goes beyond there.
It will be transferred to the Internet.
<unk> even tools like <unk> <unk> to infect our computer with a <unk> to allow them to see all the communication, and listen to the discussions online, to get our data.
When we think hard about things like these the obvious answer should be, "Well, it seems a bad thing, but it doesn't really affect me.
Why do you <unk>
I have nothing to <unk>
And that argument doesn't make sense.
It's in play.
privacy.
It's not a question of privacy against safety.
It's about freedom versus control.
If you could trust our governments today, and 2011, any right thing that we're going to do, today, will be forever.

These are the questions that have to worry about the next 50 years.
This is where I live in Kenya, in the south part of Yellowstone National Park.
These are the cows of my dad, at the bottom, and behind the cows of the National Park in Nairobi.
The National Park in Nairobi has no fences at most of the South, which means that wild animals like <unk> migrate outside of the park.
And predators, like the lions, and this is what they do.
<unk> our cattle.
This is one of the ones that killed the night, and so soon we wake up in the morning, and I found it dead -- I felt very bad because it was the only <unk> we had.
My community, the <unk> we think we came out of the sky with our animals and all the land to <unk> and so we value them so much.
So I grew up a lot to lions.
They were dying of warriors that protect our community and livestock and they're also mad at the problem.
So kill lions.
This is one of the six lions killed in Nairobi.
I think this is so few in the National Park in Nairobi.
A kid in my community, for the age of nine to nine years is responsible for livestock of his father, and this was the same thing that was happening to me.
So I had to find a way to solve this problem.
My first idea was to use fire, because I thought that lions were afraid of them.
But I realized that this is actually not <unk> because even helping the lions see the pen in far.
I didn't get <unk> <unk>
A second idea was to use a <unk>
He was trying to trick lions so that they believed that he was near <unk>
But the lions are very smart.  They came the first day and saw the <unk> and they were gone, but the second day, they went back and said, this thing isn't moving, it's always here.  So jumped and killed animals.
So one night I was walking around the pen with a torch and lions did not come.
I discovered that lions are afraid of the light that moves.
So I had an idea.
And I got a switch switch on and turn off the lights.
And this is a little lamp of a glowing <unk>
They get it out.
As you can see, the solar cell loads and the battery picks up the electricity to the little box <unk> I call it a transformational.
And the <unk> box makes the lights out.
As you can see, the <unk> take out, because that's where the lions.
And this is what lions see when they come from night.
The lights <unk> and <unk> the lions in order to think that I'm walking through <unk> but I'm sleeping in my bed.
Thank you.
So I put them in my house two years ago, and since then, we never went back to having lions.
And the neighborhood houses have been the idea.
One of them is from this grandmother.
She had killed a lot of animals, the lions and he asked me if I could put the lights.
I said yes.
<unk> you can see at the bottom, these are the lights for lions.
Since then, I've installed it in seven houses in my community, and they're serving a lot.
And my idea is also used by a whole Kenya, to scare other predators as usual, and it's also using to hurt their farms.
Because of this invention, I was fortunate to get a scholarship in one of the best schools in Kenya, <unk> International School, and I'm very excited.
My new school is now helping raising funding.
I even took my friends to my community and we installed lights in the houses that don't have them, and I show them how to <unk>
So a year ago, it was just a kid at meadows of the savanna, the cows of my father, and I used to see flying airplanes and said that someday I would be inside one.
And here I am.
I got the opportunity to come in plane for the first time at TED.
My great dream is to get to be a <unk> engineer, and pilot when he grow.
I used to hate the lions, but now as my invention is saving the cows of my dad and the lions, we can be with lions without any conflict.
<unk> <unk> What in my language means very much.
Chris Anderson: You don't picture how exciting that is listening to a story like anything.
So you got a scholarship. Richard <unk> Yes.
CA: You're working on other electric life.
What's the next thing in your list?
<unk> My next invention is -- I want to make a close electric CA: <unk>
<unk> I know that there are <unk> but I want to do my own.
CA: So let me go back a time, right, right, and <unk> <unk> I've tried it before, but I stopped because I got a <unk>  CA: <unk> Richard <unk> are a big thing.
We're going to get it on every single step that I would call my friend.
Thank you very much. <unk> Thank you very much.
When I was a little girl, I thought my country was the best of the planet.
And I grew up singing a song called "Don't <unk>
And I felt very proud of it.
In school, we would spend all the time studying the history of Kim <unk> but we never learned a lot of the rest of the world, except that America, South Korea are enemies.
But sometimes I wondered about the rest of the world, I thought I would spend my whole life in North Korea, until everything changed suddenly.
When I was seven years old, I saw my first public job.
But I thought that my life in North Korea was normal.
My family wasn't poor and myself had never been hungry.
But one day, in 1995, my mom brought home a letter of my colleague of my sister.
That said, "When do it get to this, the five members of the family will stop there in this world, because we haven't eaten in the two weeks before.
We're moving together on the floor, and our bodies are so holes, that we're ready to die."
I was very altered.
It was the first time I heard that people were suffering in my country.
As long as I was walking in front of the train, station, I saw something terrible that I can't erase my memory.
A woman without life was dead on the street, holding a kid in his arms looking at the face of his mother without being able to do anything.
No one <unk> because they were really concerned about taking care of them and their families.
A huge famine hit North Korea in the <unk>
In the end, more than a million Koreans died during the famine and only a few survived survived eating grass, insects and <unk>
They also became more and more common and more common and <unk> all my way around it was completely dark at the night except for the sea lights in China, barely crossing the river from my house.
I always wondered why they had light and we don't.
This is a satellite satellite picture at the night compared to the neighboring countries.
This is the <unk> River, which is <unk> between North Korea and China.
As you can see, the river can be very <unk> in certain points, allowing North Koreans to cross <unk>
But many people die.
Sometimes, I saw bodies floating on the river.
I can't reveal the details of how I got out of North Korea, but I can only say that during the years of famine was sent to China to live with their <unk>
But I just thought I'd be separated from my family for the short time.
I could never have imagined that would take 14 years back to live together.
In China, it was hard to live as a young woman without my family.
I had no idea what life would be like as a refugee camp.
But as soon as I learned that it's not just extremely hard, but also dangerous, because the refugee refugees in China were considered illegal <unk>
So I was living with a constant fear that my identity was <unk> and it would be <unk> to a horrible destination back in North Korea.
One day, my worst nightmare was done when I was organized by the Chinese police and <unk> in the police station.
Someone had been accused of being <unk> so I <unk> my skills in the Chinese language and made a lot of questions.
I was <unk>
I thought my heart was going to explode.
If it didn't look natural, it could be incarcerated and <unk>
I thought my life was going to end.
But I managed to control my emotions and said the questions.
At the end of the <unk> an official told another, "This was a fake.
And he was left to go. It was a miracle.
Some North Koreans in China are seeking in <unk>
But many of them can be arrested for Chinese police and <unk>
These women were very lucky.
Although there were <unk> they were eventually released after an international pressure.
These North Koreans were not so much lucky.
Every year, countless Koreans are captured in China and <unk> to North Korea, where they're <unk> incarcerated or executed in public.
Though I was fortunate to get away many other Koreans have not had so much fortune.
It's tragic that North Koreans have to hide their identities and fight so hard to survive.
Even after learning a new language and finding work, all their world can be done in an instant.
That's why after 10 years of hiding my identity, I decided to be <unk> going to South Korea.
And I started a new life again.
<unk> South Korea was a much greater challenge than I had expected.
English was very important in South Korea, I had to start learning my third language.
And also, I understood that there was a big gap between North and South.
We're all <unk> but inside, we have come to be very different because of <unk> years of <unk>
I even went through an identity.
I'm <unk> or <unk>
Where am I? Who am I?
Suddenly, there was no country that I could call up with me.
Although <unk> to South Korea was not easy, I made a plan. I started studying for the exam to college.
Just when I was starting to <unk> my new life, I got an alarming call.
The North Korean authorities was a little bit of money that sent my family to my family, and how my family was going to be shifted to force to a place in <unk>
They had to run away from it.
So I started planning how to <unk>
North Koreans have to travel long distances on the way towards freedom.
It's almost impossible to cross the border between North Korea and South Korea.
So, ironically, took an flight to China and walked to the border of North Korea.
Because my family could not talk to Chinese, I had to take it in a way, for more than three thousand miles across China, and then through Southeast Asia.
The journey in <unk> took a week, and we almost were trapped several times.
Once, our bus was arrested and tackled by an official police officer.
He asked everyone. And he started asking them questions.
As my family could not understand Chinese, I thought my family was going to be arrested.
When the Chinese official came up to my family, <unk> I stood up and I told him that they were <unk> who was <unk>
I looked at me <unk> but fortunately I believed me.
We did all the way to the border of <unk>
But I had to spend almost all my money to bribing the guards, <unk> <unk>
But even after spending the border, my family was arrested and incarcerated for crossing the border of <unk>
After paying <unk> and bribes, my family was released in a month.
But eventually my family was arrested and incarcerated again in the capital capital.
This was one of the most <unk> points in my life.
I did everything to liberate my family, and we were so close, but my family was <unk> in prison at short of South Korea.
I was going to go and come in between the immigration office and the police station, desperately trying to liberate my family.
But I didn't have enough money to pay more bribes or <unk>
I lost hope.
At that point, or the voice of a say, "What's the problem?"
I was so amazed that a stranger would care to ask.
With my poor English and a dictionary, I gave it the situation, and without <unk> the man was the <unk> and he gave me the rest of the money for my family and for another two North America, and to take them from prison.
I read it with all my heart, and I said, "Why do I get <unk>
"I'm not <unk> he said.
"I am helping the village <unk>
I realized that that was a symbolic moment in my life.
The nice unknown <unk> a new hope for me and for the village, when you get more <unk>
And it showed me that the kindness of the strangers and the support of the international community are really the rays of hope that the village <unk>
And over time, after our long trip, my family and I met in South Korea, in South <unk>
But their freedom is just half the battle.
Many North Koreans are separated from their families and when they went to a new country, they start with little or no money.
So we can benefit from the international community with education, practice English schools, of work, and more.
We can also act as a bridge between people inside North Korea and the rest of the world.
Because a lot of us are still in contact with family with still inside, and we send information and money that is helping to change North Korea from the inside.
I have been very <unk> I've received a lot of help and inspiration in my life, so I want to help North Koreans an opportunity to thrive with international support with international support.
I'm sure you're going to see more and more North Koreans all over the world, including at the TED stage.
Thank you.
I live in South <unk>
This is <unk> stores of <unk> fast food, fast, <unk>
So the planners of the city came together, and we thought, let's change the name of South <unk> to represent something more, so that they changed to Los Angeles -- like this, what is actually wrong in the city.
This is the South L.A., South food, <unk> <unk> <unk>
Just like billions of other Americans, I live in a food desert, and the South Carolina, home of the places of food to take and eat in the car.
The curious thing is that the places of food to carry kills more people than food in the car.
People are dying of <unk> diseases in the South <unk>
For example, the rate of obesity in my neighborhood is five times larger than say, Beverly <unk> which is about 15 miles away.
And I'm going to see that happen.
And I ask myself, how would you feel if you didn't have access to healthy food, and if every time you go from home you see the <unk> effects that the current food system has in its <unk>
I see chairs from <unk> and sold as well as cars.
I see <unk> centers like <unk>
And I consider this to stop.
I think the problem is the solution.
Food is the problem and it's the solution.
And I also got tired of doing 45 minutes back and back to buy an apple that doesn't have pesticides.
What I did, was planting a food forest in front of my house.
In a period of land that we call a <unk>
It's about 45 to three myself.
The point is, it belongs to the city.
But you have to keep it.
I said, "Well, I can do what I'm going to come up with -- because it's my responsibility and I have to <unk>
This is how I decided to keep it.
So my group and I, L.A. Green. We get together and we started planting our forest of food, trees, <unk> -- you know, the nine full vegetables know.
What we do, we're kind of a group of group paid by gardeners of all the <unk> of all the <unk> and completely voluntary and all that we do is free.
And the garden, was beautiful.
Then someone gets <unk>
The city is going to be on top of me and summary I got a <unk> saying that I had to take my yard, <unk> was done <unk>
And I said, "Go on, right?
A criminal order for planting food in a piece of land that no one <unk>  So I was like, "Well, you are."
Because this time was not going to happen.
The Times Times had been written by Steve <unk> and I talked to the <unk> and one of the <unk> members who put a petition in <unk> with 900 <unk> we were a success.
We had the victory in our hands.
My <unk> even called it to say, <unk> and <unk> what we were doing.
I mean, we go, why isn't it?
L.A. is the city of the United States more <unk>
It has 68 miles of <unk>
That equals 20 Central <unk>
That's hard enough to plant <unk> million plant plants.
Why does it not look at this?
<unk> a plant will give you a thousand seeds.
When a dollar of <unk> I'll give you a <unk>
It's my <unk> when I tell people, you cultivate your own food.
You know, your own food is like print your own money.
You see, I have a legacy for South Pole.
I grew up there, and I got to my kids there.
And I'm going to become part of this <unk> reality that was <unk> for others, and I'm going to make my own reality.
You see, I'm an artist.
<unk> is my <unk> I grew my art.
So as a <unk> artist who <unk> walls, <unk> <unk>
I use the garden, the ground, like a piece of canvas, and the plants and the trees, are my <unk> of that canvas.
You get to see what the land can do, if you let it be its canvas.
You simply can't imagine how amazing it is a <unk> and how it affects the people.
What happened?
I'm witnessing how my garden became a training tool for the transformation of my neighborhoods.
To change the community, you have to change the composition of land.
We are the land.
You get to see how it affects the boys.
<unk> is the most <unk> act that you can do, especially in a <unk>
You get <unk>
I remember one occasion who came a mother and his daughter, were like the <unk> of the night and they were in my backyard.
Me, well, man, I felt bad that they were there, and I said, you know, you don't have to do this.
This is on the street for a reason.
I felt shame to see people who were so close to me with hungry, and this just reinforces why I do this, people ask me, <unk> don't understand that people go to steal your <unk>
So I said, "Why? No, I don't have to fear that you go to <unk>
That's the street.
That's what it is about.
I want you to get it on, but at the time, I want you to take your <unk>
There was another occasion where I put a garden in a shelter in the center of Los Angeles.
They were these guys, who helped me download the truck.
It was great. I shared his stories about how this had been affected and how they used to plant with their mom and their grandmother, and it was fabulous to see how it changed, so just for a moment.
So Green <unk> has come to plant maybe 20 <unk>
We've had, like about 50 people who are coming from, working and <unk> every single volunteer plan.
If the kids are growing <unk> the kids will eat <unk>
If you cultivate tomatoes, they will eat <unk>  But if none of these things are taught if you don't teach them how food affects your mind and the body, eat blind what you put in front of you.
I see young people who want to work, but they have this thing where you're excited to see kids who are on this path designed for them, that doesn't take them nowhere.
With the <unk> I see an opportunity where we can train these guys who are <unk> from their communities to have a sustainable life.
And when we do this, who knows?
Maybe you get the next George Washington <unk>
But if we didn't change the composition of the ground, we never will.
Now this is one of my plans, this is something I want to do.
I want to plant the whole block of gardens, where people can share food on the same block.
I want to take containers and turn them into <unk> healthy.
I didn't know.
I'm not talking about free things, because free isn't sustainable.
The curious about sustainability is that you have to <unk>
So what I'm talking about is to try and work with the people, get the kids out of the street, who know the joy, the pride and the honor of growing their own food, opening up markets.
What I want to do here sexy.
I want you all to become <unk> <unk> <unk> gardeners <unk>
We have to change the script of what a <unk>
If you're not a <unk> you're not a <unk>
So the <unk> take your <unk>
That is their weapon of choice.
In <unk> if you want to meet me, you know, if you want to see me, you don't call me if you want to sit on comfortable chairs and have meetings to talk about making some shit.
If you want to see me, you go to the garden with your <unk> so we can plant something.
: Thank you.
Thank you.
<unk>  <unk> <unk>  You probably all agree with me that this is a really nice road net.
It's made of <unk> and the asphalt is a good material to drive, but not always, especially in days like today, where it rains, a lot.
You can have a huge amount of water in the asphalt that we have.
And especially if you go on on your bike and these cars are going to be really nice.
Also, the asphalt can make a lot of noise.
It's a noisy material, and if we build roads like in the Netherlands -- very close to cities, we would want a quiet road <unk>
The solution for that is to do emission of asphalt <unk>
<unk> <unk> a material that we use now in most of the roads in the Netherlands -- has pores and water can move through it, so that all water rain will flow sideways and have a road that is easy to drive, and they will have a road for which it's easy to drive, and no water <unk> water.
The noise also disappear in these <unk>
Because it's really <unk> all the noise disappear, so it's a very silent road down.
It also has <unk> of course, and the disadvantage of this road is that it can be <unk>
So what is it <unk> you see that on this road out of the surface <unk>
They first set out a stone and then a few more and more, and more, and so on, and <unk> well, won't do that.  But you can damage your <unk> and you won't be happy with that.
And finally, this can also lead to more and more damage.
Sometimes they can create bumps with that.
<unk> He's ready.
<unk> of course, that you can turn into a problem, but we have a solution.
So here you can really see how the damage comes in this material.
It's a splendid <unk> as I said, so it only has a little bit of <unk> between rocks.
Because of the <unk> to the light <unk> the <unk> this <unk> this <unk> the glue between the <unk> <unk> and if they were <unk> they will be <unk> and <unk> from the <unk>
So if you drive on the road, you take the <unk> as we saw it here.
So to solve this problem, we think of materials.
If we can make this material out, then we probably have a solution.
So what we can do is use wool wool from that to clean up, and we can cut the wool out of steel in very small pieces and we can mix those little bits with the <unk>
So we have asphalt with little pieces of wool steel on it.
And then you need a machine, like the ones you see here, that you can use to <unk> a <unk> machine.
<unk> can slow down, especially steel is very good at that.
So what you have to do is they heat steel <unk> melt <unk> the <unk> the flow of these <unk> and the stones <unk> back to the surface.
Today I used an oven, <unk> because I can't bring the big <unk> machine here on the stage.
The microwave oven, is a similar system.
I put the sample, I'm now going to take you to see what happened.
This is the sample coming now.
I said we have this kind of industrial machine in the lab to heat the samples.
We took a lot of samples out there, and then the government, really saw our results, and they thought, "Well, that's really interesting. We have to <unk>
So we gave us a piece of road, 400 meters from the <unk> highway, where we had to make a test lane to test this material.
So that was what we did -- you see where we were doing the test on road, and then, of course, this road last several years without any damage. That's what we know about practice.
We take a lot of this road and test them in the lab.
We did aging with the samples, we put a lot of burden on them, and we went through our <unk> machine, and we went back to a try.
We can do this a lot of times.
Well, to conclude, I can tell you that we have made a material using steel fibers to incorporating these fibers by using the energy of <unk> to actually increase the lives of the surface of the road, even you can double the life of the road, you can actually save a lot of money with very simple tricks.
And now, of course, they have a bit of wonder if this would also work.
We still have the sample here. It's pretty hot.
In fact, you have to cool it before I can show you how it acts the shoes.
But I'm going to do a try.
Let's see. Yes, it worked.
Thank you.
When I was 11, I remember myself woken up one morning with the sound of my <unk>
My father was listening to his little gray radius.
He had a great smile in his face that was unusual at those times, because the news generally <unk>
"The Taliban <unk> <unk>
I didn't know what <unk> but I could see my father was very, very happy.
"Now you can go to a <unk> school, he said.
One morning I never forget.
A real school.
You see, I was six years old when the Taliban got rid of Afghanistan and made it illegal for girls to go to school.
For the next five years, I was <unk> as a kid to <unk> my older sister who could not be used to go to a secret school.
It was the only way that we could do it <unk>
Every day, we took a different route so that nobody could suspect where they were <unk>
We had to hide the books in market bags to look like that we were shopping.
The school was in a house, more than 100 of the <unk> in a small room.
It was nice in the winter, but extremely <unk> in summer.
We all knew that <unk> our lives, the teacher, the students and our parents.
Occasionally the school turns to suddenly a week, because the Taliban Taliban did.
We always wondered what they knew of us.
They were <unk>
Did you know where it <unk>
We were <unk> but yet the school was where we wanted to be.
I was very fortunate to grow in a family where education was <unk> and the daughters a <unk>
My grandfather was an extraordinary man for his time.
A total <unk> of a remote province of Afghanistan. <unk> where his daughter, my mother went to school, and therefore his father would <unk>
But my educated mother became mastery.
This is it.
He went back two years ago, just to turn our house in school for girls and women in our neighborhoods.
And my father, this is the first of his family to receive education.
There was no doubt that their children had to receive education, even their daughters, despite the <unk> despite the risk of risk.
For him, there was a higher risk not to educate your children.
For the years of <unk> I remember that I was very frustrated for our life, and he was always scared and not see a future.
I wanted to give up, but my father said, <unk> daughter -- you can lose everything you have in life.
You can steal your money; you can get your home for a war.
But there's one thing that will always be with you, what is here, and if we have to sell our blood to pay your education, we'll do it.
So, you don't want to do it."
I am 22 now.
I grew up in a country that has been destroyed by decades of war.
Less than six percent of my age have more than high school, and if my family had not been so committed to my education, I would be one of them.
Instead, I find myself proud to graduate in <unk>
When I returned to Afghanistan, my grandfather who was <unk> from his home for the bravery of educate his daughters, was one of the first in <unk>
He was not just <unk> from my university degree, but I also was the first woman, and I'm the first woman, which I carry on the streets of Kabul.
My family believes in me.
I dream in big -- but my family has even more big dreams for <unk>
That's why I'm the global ambassador in <unk> a global campaign to educate women.
It's because of what <unk> <unk> the first and maybe the only private school for girls in Afghanistan, a country that is still dangerous for girls to go to school.
The exciting thing is that I see the students in my school with the strong desire to harness the opportunity.
And I see his parents and their families who, like the mine, <unk> for them, despite the same, even in front of an intimate opposition of it.
As <unk> It's not the real name, and I can't show you his face, but Ahmed is the father of one of my students.
Less than one month ago, he and his daughter went on the road from <unk> towards his village, and literally <unk> of being killed by a bomb on the road, for minutes.
When I got to his house, they are the phone, a voice I got to take you that if he was still sending his daughter to school, they would go to try.
<unk> now, if he said, "I'm not going to harm the future of my old daughter and <unk> ideas."
What I realized from Afghanistan, and this is something that is often forgotten in the West, is that behind most of the <unk> there is a father who recognized the value of his daughter and it sees that success of her own success.
It doesn't mean that our mothers have not been key to our success.
In fact, it's often the first <unk> compelling future of their daughters, but in the context of a society like Afghanistan, we need the support of men.
Under the <unk> girls who went to school, remember, was illegal.
But today, more than three million girls go to the school in Afghanistan.
Afghanistan looks so different from here in the United States.
I found that Americans see the fragility of changes.
It will be <unk> that these changes wouldn't last long after the retirement U.S.
But when I come back to Afghanistan, when I look at the students in my school, and their parents who were <unk> for them, that the <unk> I see the future <unk> and a lasting change.
For me, Afghanistan is a country of hope and possibilities -- and every day the girls in <unk> would be <unk>
Like me, they dream big.
Thank you.
I've never forgotten the words of my grandmother who died in <unk> <unk> resists <unk> against it.
But you never have a revolutionary <unk>
They've spent almost two years since the revolution was inspired by the surge of mass <unk> so much of the <unk> revolution.
A forces with many other citizens <unk> inside and outside of the country to call a day of <unk> and start a revolution against the <unk> regime of <unk>
And it was a big revolution.
Women and young young men were in the <unk> <unk> each of the regime, were still <unk> of freedom, dignity and social justice.
They have been an bravery in the face of the <unk> <unk>
They have shown a great sense of solidarity from the Middle East, all the way to the West.
Finally, after a period of six months of war, and a few losses from about 50 thousand people -- we managed to liberate our country and remove them to <unk>
However, <unk> left heavy charge, a legacy of <unk> corruption and <unk>
For four decades, the <unk> regime of <unk> destroyed the infrastructure, the culture and the moral structure of society.
<unk> from the devastation and the challenges, I've wanted, along with a lot of other women, reconstructing civil society <unk> <unk> a critical transition and right towards democracy and national reproduction.
There were about 200 organizations in <unk> <unk> and immediately after the fall of <unk> About 300 in <unk>
After a period of 33 years of exile, I went back to Libya, and with a single enthusiasm -- I started organizing the development of capabilities and skills of leadership.
With an incredible group of women founded the <unk> of Women <unk> by <unk> a movement of women, social orientation leaders, very <unk> to advocate for the <unk> autonomy of the woman and for our public participation in building for democracy and peace.
I found a very hard environment in the period of <unk> an environment that was increasingly <unk> which is <unk> from the selfish policies of domination, and <unk>
Over time, our initiative was approved and successful.
Women won a <unk> of the National Congress in the first choices for 52 years.
However, a little bit, the elation of elections and the revolution as a whole, were <unk> every day we found <unk>
One day we woke up with the news of the <unk> of ancient mosques and <unk>
Another day that one day <unk> with the murder of the murder of the American Ambassador and the attack at <unk>
Another day we woke up with the murder of the murder of the army from the military.
And every day, every day we woke up with the government of the <unk> and their threat from human rights of the prisoners and their lack of respect of law.
Our society, made for a <unk> mindset more and more and has been from the ideals and the principles of freedom, dignity, social justice that we had at the beginning.
<unk> <unk> and revenge became the icons of the revolution.
I'm not here today to <unk> with our history of success of <unk> <unk> and the elections.
I'm standing here today to tell us that we, as nation, we make the wrong decision.
We don't prioritize well.
Because elections did not bring peace and stability and security to Libya.
The <unk> list, and the <unk> between candidates and <unk> they brought up and reconciliation <unk>
No, they didn't.
So what happened then?
Why is our society still <unk> and dominated by the selfish policies of domination, and we <unk> both for men like for women?
Maybe what missing was not only women, but the female values of compassion, mercy and <unk>
Our society needs the national dialogue and creating consensus beyond what the election needed to do, which is just <unk> the polarization and <unk>
Our nation needs the ultimate rendering of the more than the most important rendering of it.
We need to stop acting as agents of outrage and call days of anger.
We need to start acting as agents of compassion and mercy.
We have to develop a female discourse that not just <unk> but also put it in practice <unk> rather than <unk> collaboration instead of competence, inclusion by <unk>
These are the ideals that a Libya, <unk> for war, desperately needs to be able to achieve peace.
Because peace has a <unk> which is about the <unk> and the <unk> between <unk> and <unk>
That's the real <unk>
We need to establish that in an existential way, before you do it <unk>
According to a <unk> of the Quran <unk> <unk> "is the word of God <unk> <unk> <unk>
And at the time, the word <unk> which is known in all the <unk> traditions -- it has the same root in Arabic that the word <unk> <unk> the female and <unk> which spans the entire humanity that men and women, of which all the tribes and all the people and all the people and all the people and all the people and all the people and all the people
And so just like the uterus -- it covers the <unk> that grows inside, the divine matrix of compassion is that all of us.
So he says, "My mercy goes all the things."
This is what it tells us to come up with me, "My <unk> <unk> about my <unk>
That is all <unk> the grace of mercy.
Thank you.
I'm here today to talk to you about a <unk> question, which has an answer as well.
It's about the secrets of domestic violence, and the question I'm going to deal with is why everybody gets a good <unk> why she is left?
Why was someone going to stay with a man who was <unk>
I'm not a psychiatrist, and no social worker, no expert in domestic violence.
I'm just a woman with a story that count.
He was 22 years old. I had just <unk> at Harvard University.
I had moved to New York City for my first job as a writer and editor in <unk> magazine.
I had my first apartment, my first <unk> <unk> American <unk> and he had a very big secret.
My secret was that many, many times, the man who creates my soul <unk> <unk> me on my head with a <unk> charged with <unk>
The man who loved anyone in this world, put a gun on my head and <unk> with <unk> more than I can remember.
I'm here to tell you the story of <unk> <unk> a psychological trap. <unk> of love, where fall every year of women, and even some men.
It could be his story.
I don't look like a typical survivor.
I'm a <unk> in English at Harvard University, and I have an MBA at <unk> Business <unk>
I have spent the bulk of my career working for companies for the list of <unk> <unk> between them Johnson & Leo <unk> and The Washington <unk>
I've been almost 20 years married to my second husband and have three kids.
My dog is a black <unk> a black <unk> a <unk> <unk>
So my first message for you is that domestic violence can go to anyone, all the races, all the religions, all the income levels and education.
It's everywhere.
And my second message is that everybody thinks that domestic violence happens to women, which is a problem of women.
Not exactly.
Over 85 percent of the <unk> are men, and domestic abuse just happens in <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> or, by the other way, in the families, the last place where we would want or expect to find <unk> which is why domestic abuse is so <unk>
I would have told you that it would be the last person in the world that was going on with a man who was going on, and actually was a very typical victim because of my age.
He was 22 years old, and in the United States women in between 16 and 24 years old have three times more likely to be victims of domestic violence than the other ages, and more than 500 women and girls from that age are killed every year by partners, <unk> and husbands <unk> in the United States.
I was also a typical victim, because I didn't know anything about domestic violence, their warning signals or patterns.
I met <unk> in a cold and cold night of January.
I was sitting on my side in New York subway in New York City and started with me.
He told me two things.
The first was that he also had just <unk> from a university <unk> <unk> and working on a very important bank of Wall Street.
But what struck me in that first encounter was that it was ready and fun, and that seemed like a kid in the country.
He had a lot of big <unk> like apples, and a <unk> and wheat, and it seemed so sweet.
One of the smartest things that made <unk> from the start, was to create the illusion that I was the dominant component of the partners.
He did it all over the beginning of <unk> in a <unk>
We started coming out and loved everything from me, which was list, that I had gone to Harvard, which I was passionate about helping teenage girls and my job.
I wanted to know all about my family, my childhood, my childhood, and illusions.
<unk> creates me, as a writer and as a woman, like nobody had done before.
And it was why I was in that <unk> school, and the job on Wall Street and his bright future had so much important for it.
I didn't know that the first phase in any level of domestic violence is <unk> and <unk> the victim.
And I didn't know that the second step is <unk>
Now, the last thing I wanted to do was I went from New York and leave the work of my dreams, but I thought I had to do sacrifices for your partner, so I <unk> I left my job and <unk> and I went together from Manhattan.
I had no idea that he was falling, in a <unk> <unk> which was coming out of head on a physical trap. financial trap.
The next step in the pattern of domestic violence is to introduce the threat of violence to see how it reacts it.
And here's where those <unk>
As soon as we moved to New England -- you know, that site where you were supposed to be, I had to feel so safe to buy three <unk>
One was in the <unk> of the car.
Another one he kept under the pillow in our bed and the third time in his pocket.
And he said he needed those guns to cause the trauma that they lived in a kid.
I needed them to feel secure.
But those guns were actually a message for me, and even though I had never had my hand, my life already was serious danger, every minute every day.
The first <unk> physical attack occurred five days before our wedding.
They were seven o'clock in the morning, and he had <unk>
Five days later, when the 10 bruises of my neck had disappeared, I got the girlfriend on my mother and married it.
Despite what had happened, I was sure that we were happy to live happily for always, because I loved it, and he also wanted me so much.
And I was very, very <unk>
I had just felt very <unk> for the wedding and the fact that I was making a family with me.
It had been a isolated accident, and I would never do harm.
I went twice in our moon.
The first time I was driving towards a secret beach, and he was <unk> and he gave me so hard in the head that I would call a number of times against the car <unk>
And then, a couple of days later, driving back from our moon from honey -- he went through the traffic and threw me a cold Mac to my face.
<unk> he went on one or twice a week for the next two and a half years of our marriage.
I went back to me when I thought it was the only one in this situation.
One in three American women is the victim of domestic violence or <unk> at some point in their life, and the Disease Control Center that every year 15 million children are <unk> 15 million.
So, actually, I had very good company.
So back to my question: Why do I get <unk>
The answer is straightforward.
I didn't know that he was listening to me.
On the contrary, I was a very strong woman, in love with a profoundly <unk> man, and it was the only person in the world that he could help <unk>
The other question that everybody does is, why don't they just be <unk>
Why didn't I <unk> I could have been at any time.
For me, this is the saddest and agonizing question that people do, because we were the victims, we know something that normally <unk> is incredibly dangerous to leave a <unk>
Because the last phase in the domestic violence is <unk>
More than 70 percent of death in cases of domestic violence, they happen after the victim has been late to the relationship, after <unk> because then the <unk> has nothing to lose.
Other implications include the permanent <unk> even after the <unk> has gone back to marry, <unk> of financial resources and manipulation of the family court system to <unk> the victim and their children, who are usually forced by judges to spend time not <unk>
And we still keep asking for why it's just not going on.
I was able to go, because of a final <unk> I beat my my denial.
I realized that the man I loved so much, I would have killed if it had allowed.
So I broke the silence.
I told the whole world to the police, to my neighbors and my friends and family and full strangers, and I'm here today because all of you.
We have the trend.
The question, "Why are it <unk>
So for some people is a way to say, "The fault is theirs by <unk> as if the victims of <unk> <unk> <unk> men who want to <unk>
But since I published <unk> <unk> I've heard hundreds of the stories of men and women who were also <unk> that they learned a compelling lesson from what happened to them, and their life lives joyful and moms lives like <unk> wives and mothers, lives completely free of violence, like mine.
Because it turns out that I actually am a victim, and a survivor.
I went back to <unk> with a cute little guy, and we have those three kids.
I have that black <unk> and also that <unk>
What I'm going to do is never ever get more, ever ever a <unk> <unk> my head in the hands of someone who says that he wants me.
At this point, it's just thinking, <unk> that's <unk> or <unk> what stupid <unk> but all this time I really have been talking about you.
I assure you that there are a few people who are listening to me right now, who are being <unk> or that they were kind of <unk> themselves.
<unk> could be affecting her daughter, to his sister, to his best friend right now.
I was able to end my crazy love, I was the silence.
And I keep doing it today.
It's my way to help other victims, and it's my final appeal to you.
Talk about what you've heard here.
Nuclear abuse just in silence.
They have the power to end domestic violence, just throwing light over it.
The victims need everybody.
We need every one of you to understand the secrets of domestic violence.
They would make the abuse of light talking about it with their kids, their coworkers and family and family.
You know, their vision of survivors like fantastic and fantastic people who have a <unk> future.
<unk> the early signs of violence to intervene consciously, to slow their climb and show the victims <unk>
And together we can turn our bed, our tables.
Thank you.
Hello. I call my Cameron <unk> and for a while, I'm model.
To be precise, for 10 years.
And I feel at this moment there is a <unk> tension in the room because I shouldn't have gotten dressed like this.  And fortunately, I've brought it back to <unk>
This is the first of clothing on a <unk> stage, so you have a lot of <unk> I think.
If some of the women were <unk> when you get older, you don't have to take it now, but find it later on Twitter.
I also want to point out that I have the privilege of being able to change what you think of me in just 10 seconds.
Not everybody has that opportunity.
So these mines are really <unk> less bad than I don't have to use.
The worst part is going to spend this sweater over the head, because it is when you're going to laugh at me, so you don't do anything while I took your mind.
All right.
So why do I do that?
It's been embarrassing.
Well, I hope not so much like this picture.
<unk> is powerful, but also <unk>
I've changed totally what they thought of me in six seconds.
And in this picture, he had never had a boyfriend, in real life.
I was totally <unk> and the photographer said to me that I would take the back and make it <unk> the <unk>
Of course, except with surgery or surgery or an artificial tan that I did two days ago for work, there's very little bit that we can make to transform our way -- which, while shallow and <unk> has a huge impact on our lives.
So today, for me, being courageous means to be honest.
I'm on this stage, because I'm a model model.
Because I'm a nice woman and white, and in my labor sector, that's being a sexy.
I'm going to answer the questions that people always do, but <unk>
The first question is, how are you going to be model?
And I always say, <unk> <unk> I discovered, but that doesn't mean anything.
The real reason that I made a model is because I won the genetic lottery. And I'm the <unk> of a <unk> and maybe you're asking what this inheritance.
Well, in the last few centuries. We have not just defined beauty as health, youth and symmetry, which are biologically programmed to <unk> we've also teamed up with a high and <unk> shape, and a white skin.
And that's my <unk> heritage that I have known to harness to make money.
And I know that there are people in the audience who are now showing up, and maybe there's some <unk> <unk>
First of all, the <unk> for knowing so much of models.
But sadly, I have to report that in 2007, a Ph.D. student from the University of New York -- all and every single one of the models in the <unk> and the <unk> models -- just <unk> -- that is less than four percent, not white people.
The next question that people always ask me is: Can it be model when you are."
And my first answer is, I don't know, I didn't take care of that.
But then what I really would tell each of these little girls is: Why? Can you be what you want.
You can be president of the United States, or the <unk> of the next Internet, or a surgeon <unk> ninja and poet, which would be awesome, because you're the first.
If after this spectacular list, I still <unk> No, no, Cameron, I want to be model, then I tell them, I know my <unk>
Because I'm not in charge of anything, and you could be the head of <unk> <unk> or the American executive director or the next Steven <unk>
To say that most of you want to be model is like saying that you want to win the lottery when you're larger.
It's out of your control, it's amazing, and it's not a job that you can choose.
I'm going to demonstrate all that I learned in 10 years as a model, because, unlike <unk> surgery, can be summed right now.
I don't know what happened there.
Unfortunately, once you have the studies, and you have a creator, and some work on your backs, no matter what you do, that is, if you want to be president of the United States, but you know, you want to be president of the United States for 10 years, people will be kind of weird.
The next question that people are always doing is if all the photos were <unk>
And yes, pretty much <unk> all the pictures, but that's just a little bit of what happens.
This was the first picture that was <unk> and also the first time I used a <unk> and I didn't even have my period.
I know we're moving into the personal field, but it was a girl.
So I looked at my grandmother a few months before.
These two pictures are the same day.
My friend came with me.
I'm at a <unk> party a few days before the French <unk>
So here I am with my football team.
And this is me today.
And I hope you realize that I'm not me in those photos.
They're <unk> of a group of professionals, <unk> <unk> photographers and <unk> and all their <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and they get to create this. That's not me.
Well, the next question that people always have to do is, <unk> things for free?
I have too many tons of 20 inches and I never use, but the previous couple of -- but the privilege I get in real life, and that we don't like to talk.
I grew up at Cambridge.
When I was a teenager, I was traveling with my friend who was a <unk> <unk> was jumped on a red light and of course, <unk> and <unk> a sorry, agent for being able to follow it.
<unk> of these privilege in my sense, not for what I am. and there are people who are paying a price for their way no matter who they are.
I live in New York, and last year, of the teenagers who were assigned to them and 86 percent were black and <unk> and most of them were young men.
And there are only <unk> young black and <unk> young black and <unk> in New York, so for them, it's not a question of <unk>
It is how many times <unk>
When I was looking at this talk, I learned that the 53 percent of the age of 13 years in the United States don't like their body, and that figure comes up to 78 percent to the 17.
So the last question that people ask me is: How is the life of an model?
And I think that the answer you're waiting for is: If you are a little bit thinner and you have the smartest hair, you'll feel very happy and I say.
And behind the cameras, we give an answer that maybe that would be <unk>
<unk> It's really wonderful to travel, and also incredible to be able to work with creative and passionate and passionate people.
And all of that is true, but it's just a part of what that happens, because what we never say in front of the cameras, what I have never said in front of you -- I'm insecure.
And I'm because I have to worry about myself every day.
And if you ever ask, with some more thin legs and the more bright hair, to be happier?
You just have to meet a group of models, because they have the most <unk> legs -- the brighter hair and the <unk> but probably are the physically <unk> women on the planet.
But mostly it was hard to look at a situation of racial oppression and gender when I am one of the biggest <unk>
If there is something to hold out of this talk, I hope you all feel more comfortable when you recognize the power of the image in the perception of success and fail.
Thank you.
Photography has been my passion for it since it was older enough to hold a camera, but today I want to share with you my 15 <unk> photos and I didn't belong to me.
There was no <unk> or no <unk> no chance to repeat the pictures, not even a little bit <unk>
In fact, most of them took them tourists at random.
My story starts when, <unk> in New York City to give a <unk> my wife took me this picture holding my daughter on the day of his first birthday. That is the corner of the 57 and 5.
I happened that we went back to New York -- just a year later, so we decided to take the same picture.
Well, you can imagine what comes now.
When the third birthday of my daughter, my wife said to me, why don't you take you to New York City on a <unk> journey.
So here is when we started asking for tourists that they were going to get the picture.
It's surprising that the gesture of delivering the camera to a complete stranger is so universal.
No one has been denied and, fortunately, no one has <unk>
So we were not aware of how life would change this journey.
It became something sacred for us.
This picture is a picture of a few weeks after the <unk> and I had to explain to my daughter what had happened that day that a three-year-old girl could understand.
These pictures are much more than representations of a concrete moment or a specific journey.
It's also a way to stop time in a October week and make us reflect on our time and our evolution over the years, and not only at the physical level, but in all the senses.
Because, while we always took the same picture, our perspective changes, my daughter freezes new <unk> and I can see life through your eyes and how you perceive it and interact with it.
That time in concrete that we spend together is something that we hope for illusion every year.
So recently, in one of the travel, we were walking around, when all of a sudden, he stopped dry and pointed out a red <unk> of the Lego store that was <unk> in the previous visits of the <unk>
And it described to me what I felt for the five years of standing in the same place.
<unk> who remembered their heart <unk> with the force to see that place for the first time nine years ago.
And now what looks at in New York City, because it's determined to study in New York.
And suddenly I understood that one of the most important things that we create is memories.
So I want to share the idea of actively participating in the creation of memories.
I don't know about you, but aside from these 15 pictures, I don't go on many of the family pictures.
I'm always the one that picks up the picture.
Today I want to encourage you all to appear in the picture, and you don't have to go on to someone and said, "We take a picture out.
Thank you.
I'd like to talk to you about a very special group of animals.
There are 10,000 species of birds in the world.
<unk> are in the most <unk> group.
First of all, why are they so bad <unk>
It also has been associated with Disney laughter, as a dumb silly characters.
More recently, if you've been following the <unk> press. applause and <unk> these are the attributes that they associate with Parliament, Parliament, -- but I don't accept it.
I don't accept it. Do you know why?
Because members of Parliament, don't keep the environment clean --  <unk> don't help prevent the spread of disease.
<unk> are <unk>     So my favorite, the <unk> have better presence.   There are two kinds of <unk> on this planet.
There is the <unk> in the New World who are mostly in <unk> like the <unk> and the <unk> and the Congolese <unk> in the Old World where we have 16 species of these 16, 11 face is a high risk of extinction.
So, why are the <unk> are important, and first of all, they provide life ecological services.
They are our <unk>
You know, the people to the bone.
They help killing all the bacteria to help absorb the anthrax that not to be by they would stretch and cause great losses of livestock and diseases in other animals.
Recent studies have shown that in areas where there are no <unk> people take three to four times more time in <unk> and this has huge ramifications in the spread of disease.
<unk> also have enormous historic importance.
They've been associated with the old culture.
<unk> was the default symbol and maternity and, along with the <unk> <unk> the unity between the <unk> and the Under Egypt.
In mythology <unk> <unk> was the god <unk> and risked his life to save the Tasmanian devil?
In the <unk> culture, they are very important <unk> to open sky. In places like Tibet, -- there's no place to bury the dead or wood to <unk> so these <unk> provide a natural elimination system.
What's the problem with the <unk>
We have eight species of <unk> in Kenya, of which six are in extreme <unk> of extinction.
The reason is that they're being <unk> and the reason you're being <unk> is because there are conflicts between humans and <unk> <unk> communities use this venom against predators, and as a result, the <unk> are victims of this.
In the south of Asia, in countries like India and Pakistan -- four species of <unk> are in the critical list of extinction, which means that in less than 10 or 15 years ago, which means that in less than 10 or 15 years ago, and the reason is because they fall prey on the livestock of the livestock that has been treated with a <unk> drug.
This drug has been banned for veterinarian in India, and they've taken a statement.
Because there is no <unk> there has been a spread in the number of dogs in <unk> in <unk> and when you have <unk> dogs -- has a huge bomb bomb -- the number of <unk> of anger has increased enormously in India.
Kenya is going to have one of the biggest wind wind in Africa, <unk> <unk> you're going to be up from Lake <unk>
I'm not on wind energy, but we have to work with governments, because wind turbines do this to the birds. They cut it in half.
They are <unk>
In West Africa, there is a horrible trade of dead <unk> to serve <unk> and the market market.
So what are you doing? Well, we're investigating these birds. We are <unk> <unk>
We're trying to determine their basic ecology, and see where they go.
We can see that travel through different countries, so I will be able to focus on a living problem isn't going to serve anything.
We have to work with governments in the <unk>
We're working with local communities.
We are talking to them about appreciating the <unk> about the need to appreciate these wonderful creatures and the services that we make.
How can they help? It can become assets, making noise. You can write a letter to their government and tell you we have to focus on these very <unk> <unk> <unk> their time to spread the word.
When you get out of this room, I will tell you about <unk> but talk to their families, with their children, with their neighbors on the <unk>
They're very <unk> Charles Darwin said that he changed because he saw them fly without effort, without any energy spending in the heavens.
Kenya, this world, will be much more poor without these wonderful species.
Thank you very much.
Every thing I do and everything I do -- my life has been <unk> for seven years of work during my youth in Africa.
From <unk> to <unk> <unk> young people, but I am.  I worked in Zambia, Kenya, <unk> <unk> and Somalia.
I worked for an NGO <unk> and every project that we set up in sub-Saharan Africa.
And it was <unk>
We went to the 21, that Italians were good at the time, and we were doing a good job in Africa.
Instead of all the things that we were going to do is <unk>
Our first project, which inspired my first book, <unk> from the <unk> was a project where a few Italians -- we decided to teach people in country to grow food.
So we got seed seeds in the south of country to this absolute valley to this absolutely magnificent valley drops towards the <unk> River.
Of course, the people were not at all interested in doing that, because of what they were <unk> to come to work, and some times, they weren't going to be <unk>  We were even surprised that the local in so fertile -- in such fertile valley, they didn't have to survive.
And yet, instead of asking you how it was possible that we don't know anything, we just said, "Thank God we're here."  We went to time to save the people in the country.
And of course, all in Africa grew <unk>
We got these magnificent <unk> In Italy, a tomato tomato -- this size.
And we couldn't believe -- we were saying to the <unk> "Look how easy it is <unk>
When the tomatoes were beautiful, <unk> and red in the night in the morning, about 200 <unk> appeared from the river and ate it all.  And we said to the <unk> my God, <unk>
And the <unk> said, "Yes, that's why we don't have agriculture here."  "Why don't you say, "You're never <unk>
I thought we just have the Italians -- <unk> errors in Africa, but then, I saw what the Americans, what the Americans, what they did, and what they were doing, and then to see what they were doing, I felt pretty proud of our project in Zambia.
Because, you see, at least we feed the <unk>
So let's see the <unk>  <unk> to see the waste that we would give them to the <unk> people in Africa.
She wants to read a book, reading <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> economist, <unk>
The book published in 2009.
We, Western donors have delivered to the African continent two million dollars in the last 50 years.
I'm not going to tell you about the damage that that money has <unk>
Just read your book.
<unk> from part of an African woman, the harm that we've done.
Our Westerners are <unk> wonderful <unk> and we treat people just about two things: or <unk> or we're <unk>
The two words come from the Latin root <unk> which means <unk>
They mean two different things.
<unk> I deal with any of a different culture as if you were my kids, you want a lot."
<unk> I'm trying to deal with all of the things in a culture like my <unk>
So the white ones in Africa are called <unk> boss.
That book gave me a slap on my face, "The little bit is <unk> written by <unk> who said above everything economic development, if people don't want to be <unk> <unk>
This should be the first principle of help.
The first principle of aid is <unk>
This morning, the gentleman who opened this conference, put a cane on the floor, and he said, we can -- you might -- you can imagine a city that's not <unk>
I decided to the 27 years just respond to people, and invented a system called <unk> <unk> where you never start anything, you never motivates anyone, but it becomes a <unk> of the local passion, the <unk> of local people who have the dream of becoming a better person.
So what do you do? They <unk>
You can never get a community with an idea, and it sits on the <unk>
We didn't work from offices.
We met in a coffee. We met on a bar.
We have zero infrastructure.
And what do we do? We turned into friends, and we really found what the person wants to do.
The most important thing is passion.
You can give you an idea to anybody.
If that person doesn't want to do that, what do you do?
The passion that she has for its own growth is the most important thing.
The passion that man has for its own personal growth is the most important thing.
And then we help them find the knowledge because no one in the world can be success alone.
The person with the idea may not have the knowledge, but knowledge is available.
So years and years ago, I had this idea: Why not us, for once instead of reaching a community to tell people what to do, why not, for once, but not in <unk>
I'll tell you a secret.
There's a problem with <unk> meetings.
The entrepreneurs never <unk> and they will never tell you in a public meeting, what they want to do with their own money, what opportunity have <unk>
So planning has this blind person.
The smartest person in their community, you don't even know about it, because they don't take your public meetings.
What do we do? We work one to one, and we work face our face, you have to create a social infrastructure, which doesn't exist.
You must create a new profession.
The profession is the family doctor for the company, the family doctor in the business, which has set up with you in your house on the kitchen table, in the coffee table, and that helps you find the resources to transform their passion in a way of living.
I started this as a test in <unk> the city of western Australia,
I was doing a Ph.D. at that time, trying to get away from this <unk> garbage where we got to tell you what to do.
In one year, I had 27 projects online, and the government came to see me to say, "How can you do that?
How can I do that?" I said, "I did something very, very hard.
And so --  So the government says, <unk> --  So the government says, <unk> <unk>  So we've done it in 300 communities in the world.
We have helped to start 40,000 businesses.
There's a new generation of entrepreneurs who are dying of loneliness.
And Peter <unk> one of the most grandiose business advisers in history, passed away to '96, a few years ago.
And Peter <unk> was a professor of philosophy before I got involved in business, and this is what Peter <unk> <unk> is actually incompatible with a society and a <unk> economy.
planning is the kiss of the death of the business spirit.
So now <unk> reconstructing <unk> <unk> without knowing what the most <unk> people in <unk> want to do with their own money and their own energy.
You have to learn how to get these people to talk to you with you.
You have to offer you <unk> privacy, has to be fantastic to the <unk> and then we'll get it very on.
In a community of 10,000 people, we get 200 clients.
You can imagine a community of 400,000 and the intelligence and the passion?
So what are you going to show you more about this tomorrow now.
And local people <unk> That's what you have <unk>
So what I'm telling you is that the entrepreneurial spirit is where it is.
We're at the end of the world's first industrial revolution -- fossils -- not renewable energy, and one moment to another, we have systems that are not sustainable.
The internal combustion engine is not sustainable.
<unk> as a way of holding <unk> is not sustainable.
So what we have to consider, is how do we get <unk> <unk> <unk> communicate to seven billion people, in a sustainable way.
There are no technologies to do it.
Who is going to invent the technology for the green revolution, <unk> <unk>
government?
They will be the entrepreneurs and they're doing it now.
There's a lovely story that I read in a <unk> magazine many, many years ago.
There was a group of experts who were invited to debate the future of New York City <unk>
And in the year on, they came up with this group of people, and <unk> about what would happen to New York City in 100 years, and the conclusion was <unk> New York City would not exist within 100 years.
Why? Because they looked at the curve and <unk> if the population is kept growing to this <unk> to move to the population of New York City -- <unk> six million horses, and the manure produced for six million horses, would be impossible to address.
They were already <unk> in dung.  So in <unk> they were <unk> this dirty technology that would make the life in New York.
So what happens? In the next 40 years, in 1900, in the United States in the United States of the United States came up with <unk> generic companies <unk>
The idea of finding a different technology was absolutely <unk> and there were very few factories in <unk>
<unk> Michigan. Henry Ford Ford Ford Ford Ford Ford Ford Ford Ford Ford Ford Ford Ford Ford Ford Ford Ford Ford Ford Ford Ford Ford Ford Ford Ford Ford Ford Ford Ford Ford Ford Ford Ford Ford Ford Ford Ford Ford Ford Ford Ford Ford Ford Ford Ford Ford Ford Ford Ford Ford Ford Ford Ford Ford Ford Ford Ford Ford Ford Ford Ford Ford Ford Ford Ford Ford Ford
There's a secret to work with the entrepreneurs.
First, you have to offer you."
Otherwise not come to talk to you.
Then, you have to offer you an absolute dedicated <unk>
And then I'm going to have to tell you the truth about <unk>
The smaller company -- the biggest company -- it has to be able to make three things <unk> the product that you want to sell to sell has to be a fantastic, you have to tell you with a fabulous financial administration.
Do you know what?
We've never met a single human being in the world that can be able to sell and look for money alone.
It doesn't exist.
This is not born.
We have looked at and looked at the 100 <unk> companies, <unk> <unk> Ford, all the new companies, Google, <unk>
There's only one thing that all successful companies in the world have in common -- just one: no one was started by one person.
The word is, but the word <unk> 32 times.
He was not just when he began.
No one begins a company alone. Nobody.
So we can create the community where we have <unk> who come from a small environment of small business <unk> in coffee next to their dedicated comrades who will do for you, what someone did for this <unk> someone who will ask you, what need to take?
What can you do it?
Well, you can see it <unk> You can look at the <unk>
"Oh, no, I can't do that." You know, <unk> <unk>
We activate communities.
Thank you.
Those of us can help us in many ways to improve our lives.
We don't know all the neighbors, so we don't change a lot of knowledge despite the same public space.
In the last few years I've tried to share more with my neighbors in the public space, with simple tools like <unk> <unk> and chalk.
These projects came from questions like, how much pay my neighbors for their <unk>
How can we pay and borrow more things without calling the door at a bad time?
How do we share more memories of our abandoned buildings and understand better our <unk>
How do we share our hope for empty stores for our communities to be able to reflect our needs and <unk>
I live in New <unk> and I'm in love with New <unk>
My soul always finds a relief with giant <unk> which give a shadow to <unk> <unk> and <unk> for centuries and trust a city.
It always gives the music.  There's a <unk> <unk>  The city has one of the most beautiful character in the world, but also one with the largest American properties in the United States.
I live near this house and thought how it could turn it into a more nice space for the neighborhood and also something that changed my life forever.
In 2009 I lost someone who loved a lot.
It was <unk> as a mother to <unk>
She was sudden and unexpected.
I thought a lot about death and death.
And this led to me a profound gratitude for the time and lived in the way.
He gave it clarity to the significant things of my life today.
But let me keep this look in my life in my life.
It seems to be easy to be able to catch the day to day and forget the really important thing for one.
So with the help of old and new friends transformed the wall of this abandoned house on a giant slate on a giant <unk> and painted on her phrases to <unk> it before he died <unk>
So the <unk> could take a <unk> reflect on their lives and share personal aspirations in public space.
I didn't know what to wait for this experiment, but the next day the wall was full and kept <unk>
And I would like to share some things that people wrote on the wall.
Before he died, I want to be tested by <unk>  before I stopped dying -- I want to sit on the line of change in <unk>
Before I died, I want to sing for millions of people."
Before I would die I want to plant a <unk>
Before he died, I want to live out of <unk>
Before he died, I want to take you once again."
Before he died, I want to go to the Treasure rescue.
Before he died, I want to be totally myself myself."
This outer space became <unk> and the dreams and hope and hope of people made me laugh at <unk> and they gave me comfort in hard times.
It's about knowing that you're not alone. It's about understanding our neighbors in new ways and <unk> it's about supporting the reflection and <unk> and remember what is most important for us as we grow and <unk>
This happened last year and started getting hundreds of messages of passionate people who wanted to make a wall in their community.
So with my colleagues in the center of civic center, we made a kit and now have been done walls in countries around the world, like South Africa, Australia, Argentina and beyond.
And together we proved the power of our public spaces if they give us the opportunity to express ourselves and share each other.
Two of the most valuable things we have are time and our relationships with other people.
In our age, in our age, it's more important than ever, to find ways to preserve the perspective and remember that life is brief and delicate people.
The death is something that we often avoid talking about, or even to think, but I understood that for death is one of those things that are going to be more power.
Think about death <unk> our life.
Our shared spaces can reflect better than we care about individuals and as a community and more media to share hope and stories, the people around us cannot only help improve places, can help improve our lives.
Thank you.
Thank you.
I have a single request.
Please don't tell me that I'm normal.
Now I'd like to introduce you to my siblings.
<unk> She's 22 and very hot.
We don't talk about it, but it gives you joy than some of the best speakers.
<unk> knows what love.
It's shared. <unk> happens what will happen.
It's not <unk> You don't look at the color of the skin.
It doesn't care about religious and mind in this: It has never been <unk>
When I sing about our childhood, trying to hear the words that I could not even <unk> it reminds me of one thing: how little we know about the mind and how wonderful it must be the unknown.
Samuel is 16 years old. It's very hot.
<unk> the <unk> memory.
But it's a selective memory.
It doesn't remember if I stole my <unk> but remember the year that he came out every single songs of my iPod and conversations that we had when I was four years old -- you know, in my arm for the first episode of the <unk> and <unk> birthday <unk>
It doesn't look like that.
But most people don't agree with it.
And in fact, because their minds don't fit into the concept of <unk> society, often are <unk> and <unk>
But what propelled me to my heart and <unk> my soul was that even if that was the case, if you didn't consider them in the <unk> that could only mean one thing: They were autistic and extraordinary.
Now, for those less familiar with the term <unk> it's a complex brain disorder that affect social communication, to learning, and sometimes physical skills.
In every single individual, it manifests itself differently, from there that will be so different from Sam.
And around the world, every 20 minutes, they were diagnosed with a new case of autism, and even though it's one of the developing development disorders in the world, there's no cause or no cure for it.
I don't remember my first encounter with autism, but I don't remember one day without it.
I had only three years when my brother came to the world, and I was very excited to have a new being in my life.
When a few months, I realized that he was different.
<unk> a lot.
I didn't want to play as the other babies and, in fact, it didn't seem very interested in me at all.
<unk> lived and <unk> in his own world, with his own rules, and I found pleasure in the smallest stuff, like putting the cars in row around the room, looking at the machine, looking at anything that would have the <unk>
As I grew up, it became more different, and the differences were made more apparent.
But beyond the <unk> frustration and frustration and <unk> there was something really <unk> a pure nature and innocent nature of a kid who looked at the world without <unk> a human being that had never been <unk>
<unk>
I can't deny that there have been some tough moments in my family, moments where I wish they were just like me.
But I look back at the things that have taught me about <unk> communication and love, and I realize that they're things that would not want to change the normal.
<unk> goes through the beauty that give us the differences and the fact that we're different doesn't mean that some of us are wrong.
It just means there's a different view of what is right.
If I could <unk> one thing to <unk> and Sam and for you, it would be that you don't have to be normal.
They can be extraordinary.
Because, autistic or not, the differences that are <unk> and every one of us has a gift in your inside and honestly, the pursuit of <unk> is the last sacrifice of potential.
The opportunity for <unk> progress and change is at the time where we're trying to be the others.
Please don't tell me that I'm normal.
Thank you.
Five years ago, I experienced a little bit of what must have been <unk> in the <unk>
Penn State was asked to me, a professor of communications, who would give a kind of communication to students in engineering.
I was afraid.  <unk> the truth.
But in the middle of those conversations, I felt what <unk> must have felt when I fell through the <unk> <unk> and he saw the door of a new world.
So I just felt when I had those conversations with the students. I was inspired by the ideas that they had, and I wanted others to experience this wonderful world.
And I think the key to opening that door is a great communication.
We really need a great communication of our scientists and engineers to change the world.
Our scientists and engineers are the ones who are attacking our larger challenges -- from energy to environment and health care and health care among others, and if we don't know about this, the job is not done, and I think it's our responsibility as we didn't have these interactions.
But these big conversations cannot happen if our scientists and engineers are not invited to see their whole world.
So scientists and engineers, please, <unk> <unk>
I want to share some suggestions on how you can do it to make sure that you can see that their science is sexy and their engineering is attractive.
First question for us, and then what?
We know why science is relevant to us.
Don't tell us just that you study the <unk> but they study the <unk> that are the mesh structure of our bones because it's important to understand and treat the <unk>
And when you're describing your science, care with <unk>
<unk> is an obstacle to our understanding of its ideas.
Sure, you can say <unk> and <unk> but why don't you say <unk> and <unk> which is much more accessible to us?
<unk> affordable is not the same thing as the <unk>
Rather, as Einstein said, everything is as simple as possible, but not simple.
They can clearly communicate their science without engaging the ideas.
Something to consider is to use examples, and stories and analogies. They are ways of <unk> and <unk> with their content.
And when you present your job, forget about the signs.
And they have wondered why they're called <unk>  What do the bullets do the bullets -- the bullets and their presentation.
A <unk> like this is not just boring, but it's supporting too much in the language of our brain and <unk> us.
Instead, this <unk> example of <unk> Brown is much more effective, it shows that the special structure of <unk> is so strong that really inspired the unique design of the <unk>
So the trick here is to use a simple sentence, which the public can understand if you lose a little bit, and then provide graphics that we will go to our other senses, and create a deeper sense of understanding of what it was <unk>
I think these are just some keys that can help us to help the rest of the door and see the country of wonders that is science and engineering.
And so, scientists and engineers, when they have solved this equation, for every media -- <unk> <unk>  Thank you.
One of my favorite words from all the former English word of English is <unk>
Just because it sounds very well.
And <unk> means <unk> <unk>
Although there was an editor called the 19th century that defined a lot better when he said, "A <unk> is that you look for a public drink, no matter or on the platform, and then when he won, it gets it by the mere use of a monumental <unk> <unk>
I have no idea of what it means.
Something to do with words, I guess.
It's very important that words are the basis in politics, and that all the politicians know that they have to try to master language.
It was not <unk> for example, <unk> that British Parliament allowed the newspapers to quote the exact words that were said in the <unk>
And all of this was because of the bravery of a guy with the rare name of <unk> <unk> who was faced with <unk>
He put it on the Tower of London and he <unk> but he had enough courage to cope with them, and at the end he had such popular support in London that I won in the end.
And only a few years later, we had the first use of the phrase <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> like <unk>
Most people think it's literal way.
It's not. It's because of a advocate of freedom of expression.
But to show you really how words and politics interact, I want you to go back to the United States, right after independence.
So, they had to address the question of how to call George Washington, their leader.
They didn't know.
How do you call the leader of a <unk> country.
This is <unk> in Congress for a long time.
There were all kinds of suggestions that you might have <unk>
Some of them wanted to call it <unk> <unk> and others, "Your <unk> George <unk> and other <unk> from the American <unk>
Not very <unk>
Some of them just wanted to call it <unk>
They thought it was proved to be done.
And not even with that were <unk> they had the idea that you could be chosen for a fixed term.
And I could have <unk>
Everyone got tired <unk> because this debate would be <unk> for three weeks.
I read the day of a poor <unk> and always <unk> <unk> with this <unk>
Which caused <unk> and <unk> was that the House of <unk> was against the <unk>
The <unk> did not want Washington to be <unk>
They didn't want to call it the King for whether it would give him or his designated ideas.
So they wanted to give it the most <unk> more <unk> and more unfortunate title that they came up with.
And that title was <unk>
President. They didn't invented the title before, but it just meant <unk> that I would take a <unk>
It was like the president of a jury.
And I didn't have much more <unk> than the term <unk> or <unk>
There was <unk> presidents of little <unk> <unk> and <unk> of government, but it was really a insignificant.
And that's why the Senate was <unk>
They said, "It's ridiculous, we can't call it <unk>
"This guy has to be treated and met with <unk> <unk>
"And who will take a very ridiculous title with a <unk> and insignificant title as a <unk>
And finally, after three weeks of debate, the Senate was not <unk>
We can learn three interesting things from all this.
First of all, and this is my favorite to where I have been able to figure out, the Senate has never been <unk> by the President's title.
President Barack Obama is lucky to keep there, waiting for the Senate among action.
The second thing that we can learn is that when a government says that a measure is <unk>  <unk> we can keep them waiting for <unk> years.
But the third thing we can learn -- and this is the most important, and this is the most important thing, and this is the most important title of the United States -- it doesn't sound at all as modest today, right?
Especially if you have more than 5,000 nuclear warheads to say, the largest economy in the world and a fleet of <unk> and so on.
The reality and history have doubled the title of <unk>
So I won the <unk>
They got their title of <unk>
And also the other concern of the Senate, the appearance of <unk> well, it was a uniqueness then.
But you know how many nations have now <unk>
And all because they want to sound like the guy who has 5,000 nuclear heads.
So, at the end, the Senate won and the House of <unk> <unk> because no one will be going to feel humble when you tell you that now are the president of <unk>
And I think that's the big lesson that we can learn to learn, and that I would like to <unk>
The politicians try to choose and use words to shape and control reality, but really, really change the words that they might change reality.
Thank you very much.
I'm 45 to <unk> in an illegal mine in Ghana.
The air is <unk> and dust, and it's hard to breathe.
I feel the touch of <unk> bodies in the dark, but I can't see much more.
I hear the voices who speak but above all, that cacophony of male <unk> and stones <unk> with primitive.
As others, I have a cheap flashlight of light <unk> he brought the head with this <unk> <unk> and I can barely distinguish the branches of that hole from a subway.
It was <unk> my hand, and suddenly I remember a <unk> I met days before, who lost control and fell <unk> in that well.
As I talk to you today, these men are in the deep way of that hole risk their lives without paying any reward, and often dying.
I went home from that hole and went home, but they probably never will.
In the last 28 years, I was documenting native cultures, more than 70 countries in six countries and in 2009, I had the great honor of being the only <unk> in the <unk>
Amongst all the incredible people I met there I met a <unk> <unk> the <unk> a nonprofit that is done to eradicate modern <unk>
We started talking about slavery and really, I started to learn about slavery because I knew that there was in the world, but not to such a degree.
When we finished talking to me and I felt really sad, I honestly was thrilled to ignore this <unk> of our days and I thought, if I don't know, how many people don't know?
He made me <unk> our stomach and weeks later, I flew to Los Angeles to meet the director of the <unk> the <unk> and offer my help.
So, my journey to modern <unk>
Interestingly, I had been in many of these places.
A few of them would even look at my second home.
But this time, <unk> dirty <unk>
A conservative calculation says that there are more than 27 million people <unk> in the world.
It's twice the number of displaced Africans throughout the entire <unk>
150 years ago, the cost of a slave farmer was about three times the annual wage of a U.S. worker.
The equivalent of a few <unk>
But today you can do it today to enslaving entire families by generations for <unk> <unk>
Surprisingly, slavery generates profits from over over 13 billion dollars a year around the world.
Many have been fooled by false education promises and better work to find out that they were forced to work without pay, under threat of violence, and they can't escape.
The slavery is operating in <unk> the goods produced by slaves have value, but those of them produce these are disposable them.
<unk> exist in almost all the world, and yet it's illegal throughout the world.
In India and Nepal I met the bricks.
This strange and formidable show was like getting into the old Egypt, or the <unk> of <unk>
<unk> in a <unk> temperature -- men, women, in fact, kids, in fact, entire families -- <unk> in a heavy <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> brick in their heads until 18 at the time, to 18 at the time, and they take them from the furnaces that are at hundreds of feet.
<unk> for <unk> and <unk> work in silent, doing this task over and over again for 16 -- 17 hours a day.
There was no coffee for eat, no to drink, and the severe <unk> would make pee a lot of <unk>
They were the heat and the powder that my camera turned too hot in the way too hot and stopped working.
Every 20 minutes I had to run the car to clean the team and make it work with air conditioner for <unk> and, sitting there, I thought my camera gets a much better treatment than these people.
Back in the furnaces I wanted to cry, but the <unk> who was on my side and he got me up, and he said, <unk> don't do it."
And it explained very clearly that demonstrate emotions is very dangerous in places like this, not just for me, but for them.
I could not offer any direct help.
I could not give them money, anything.
I was not citizenship in that country.
I could put them in a situation worse than they already were.
I had to rely on the <unk> the <unk> and work inside the system for his release and he trusted it to do it."
As soon as me, I waited to get home to feel my heart <unk>
In the Himalayas I found a little bit of stones for a mile per mile for <unk> to <unk>
These big <unk> were more heavy than the kids than the load and the kids put them on their heads with <unk> <unk> <unk> strings and <unk>
It's hard to witness something so <unk>
How can we influence something that <unk> but so <unk>
Some people don't even know that they are slaves -- and they work 16 or 17 hours a day without <unk> because this has been the entire life.
You have nothing with anything to <unk>
When these villagers <unk> his freedom, the <unk> had completely <unk>
When you hear the word slavery -- we often think of sexual traffic and because of this global awareness I was telling me that it would be hard for me to work with security in this particular business.
In <unk> I became <unk> women who had been previously <unk>
It drove me through some stairs <unk> that gave this <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
It wasn't exactly a <unk>
It was more a restaurant.
<unk> as they know at the craft, they are local for forced prostitution.
They have small rooms, they have small rooms, and they have small rooms with their girls and kids, some of only seven -- they're forced to entertain the clients and <unk> to buy more food and alcohol.
Each <unk> and <unk> identified by a number painted on the wall and divided by a <unk> and a curtain.
The workers often suffer sexual abuse to their clients.
On the <unk> I remember feeling a sense of <unk> <unk> and in that moment, I could barely imagine what it must be stuck in that hell.
I just had a <unk> the stairs <unk>
There was no <unk>
There were no big windows like <unk>
Those people don't have <unk> and, you know, with a really hard subject, it's important to point out that slavery -- even sexual traffic happens around us.
There are hundreds of people <unk> in agriculture, <unk> in the domestic service, and the list can continue.
So recently, the New York Times reported that between 100,000 and 300,000 children are sold every year as a sex slave themselves.
It's everywhere, but we don't see it.
<unk> are another activity that often relate to the labor of labor.
I went to Indian villages where there were Indian families in the trade of silk.
This is a family.
<unk> hands are the father, the <unk> of the blue and a red, of their children.
<unk> <unk> in these big barrels and <unk> silk in the liquid to <unk> but <unk> is <unk>
My translator told me his stories.
"We don't have <unk> they said.
You still have to be able to get out of this house one day and go to another place where you really get our job."
It's been estimated that there are more than 4,000 children <unk> in Lake <unk> the largest artificial lake in the world.
When we arrived, I went to take a look fast.
I saw what seemed to be a <unk> family on a boat, two older siblings -- some young kids -- makes sense of it?
<unk> They were all slaves.
The children are separated from their families -- <unk> <unk> and forced to work <unk> <unk> on these boats in the lake, despite not knowing swimming.
This boy is eight years old.
When our boat came up to me -- I was <unk> the subject that his little canoe was <unk>
He was paralyzed by the fear of falling into the water.
The <unk> branches of the trees plunged into Lake <unk> often trap networks and children, <unk> and with fear of the water to unlock the branches.
A lot of <unk>
Since remember, it has always been forced to work on the lake.
For fear of his love is not going to run through, and as all life has been treated with cruelty, <unk> it tries the younger slaves under their charge.
I met these guys at five o'clock in the morning, when they went through the last networks, but they had been working from the one one on one another.
In the cold and <unk>
And it's going to point out that these networks weigh more than 400 pounds when they are packed with fish.
I want to introduce you to <unk>
Kofi was rescued by a village of fishermen.
I met it in a shelter where the <unk> <unk> victims of slavery.
Kofi symbolizes the possible.
Who will be because someone decided to make the difference in your life?
We went through a road in Ghana with partners of <unk> the <unk> a fellow <unk> with their bike.
We asked us to take it through a dirt road to the jungle.
At the end of the way, we got to go out of the car, and he asked the driver to come out quickly.
Then he pointed out this path just visible and said, "This is the way, this is the way.
As we began to go down, we removed the <unk> that we put on the road and after walking closer to an hour we found out the way that the way was <unk> by the recent <unk> so I put the pictures of photos on my head as well as <unk> in these waters to the chest.
After two hours of <unk> the <unk> on the road ended up on an clear, and we had a mass of holes that could fit into a football, and everyone were full of <unk> workers.
A lot of women had bound to their backs, and they were looking for gold, <unk> in <unk> waters with <unk>
<unk> is used in the process of <unk>
These miners are <unk> in a well in another part of Ghana.
When they came out of the pump were <unk> in their own sweat.
I remember looking at his eyes tired, <unk> because many had been under land for 72 hours.
<unk> have up to 90 meters and these people carry heavy heavy bags that then will be shipped to another area where they put the stone to get the gold out.
And in the first view, the site seems to be full and strong men and <unk> but if you look closer to the margin we see at least fortunate and also children.
They are all victims of injuries, and violence.
In fact, it's very likely that this <unk> is going to end up like this victim of T.B. and <unk> for a few years.
This is <unk> When his father died, his uncle took him to work with him in mines.
When he died, his uncle, <unk> I took the debt of the uncle who force him to be slave in mines.
When I met her, I had worked in the age of 14, and the leg injury that you see here is a product of a crash in the <unk> so serious that the doctors said it had to be <unk>
In addition to that, <unk> has tuberculosis, and yet that is forced to work at night and day on that mine.
Yet, he decided to be liberated and educated with local activists like the <unk> and it's this kind of determination, for a remote possibility to a remote possibility to a remote possibility that inspires me.
I want to drop light out of slavery.
Did you know that his images would be seen for you around the world.
I wanted you to take testimony from them and make everything possible to help change their lives.
I really think that if we can see each other as humans, then it becomes very difficult to tolerate atrocities like slavery.
These images are not <unk> They are of people, real people, like you, and like me, who deserve the same rights, dignity and respect in their lives.
There is no day that I'm going to happen in these many beautiful, <unk> people that I've had the great honor to meet.
I hope that these images take a force in which you can see in people like you, and I hope that strength turns a fire and that fire <unk> light over slavery because without that light, the beast of slavery can continue to live in the shadows.
Thank you very much.
I do math applied -- and there's a particular problem for whom <unk> are like management technique.
Nobody knows what the hell we do.
So today, I'm going to try to explain what I do.
The dance is one of the human activities.
We <unk> the <unk> of the ballet and the dance dancers --  that we'll see more on.
But the ballet demands a degree of extraordinary, extraordinary training -- a high level of skill, and probably certain initial <unk> that can have a genetic component.
Unfortunately, disorders like Parkinson's Parkinson's disease, gradually this extraordinary skill, as it does with my friend <unk> <unk> which, at their time was a virtuous dancer ballet dance.
Over the last few years has made a lot of progress in the treatment.
But there are <unk> million people in the world who are sick, and they have to deal with a <unk> weakness <unk> and other symptoms of this disease, so we need to use tools to detect the disease before it's too late.
We need to be able to measure progress in an objective way, and ultimately, the only way we can know if there really is a cure that we have an objective and an objective metric and <unk>
But it's frustrating that for Parkinson's and other disorders.
You have to go to a clinic. It's very, very expensive, and that means that, out of trials are never done. It's never done.
And what if patients could do it at home?
That would save a journey of <unk> to the clinic. What if patients could make the exam <unk>
It would not take care of it.
By the way, it costs about 300 dollars in the <unk> clinic.
So what I want to do, as a conventional way to try -- you can see, in some sense at least, we're all <unk> like my friend <unk> <unk>
This is a video of the vibration from <unk>
It shows someone healthy while it emits sounds when we can speak as a vocal ballet dancers because we have to coordinate all those vocal organs to produce sounds and all of us have the genes needed to produce sounds and for example.
And like ballet requires a level of extraordinary training.
Let's think of the time that he takes a child to learn to speak.
From the sound, we can track the position of the vocal cords as they do, and as Parkinson's as the Parkinson's affects the <unk> it also affects the <unk> organs.
On the plots of the bottom here, you can see an example of shake from the elastic strings of it.
We see the same <unk>
shake a <unk> weakness and <unk>
The speech becomes more quiet and <unk> after a while, and this is an example of the symptoms.
How do you compare these tests based on the voice of <unk> clinical <unk> Well, they're both not <unk>
The neurological test is not <unk> both use existing infrastructure.
You have no need to design a whole series of hospitals to do it.
It's both <unk> OK, but also the tests on the voice are not <unk>
I mean, they can be <unk>
They do very quickly, take about 30 seconds like a lot.
They're at the minimum cost and we all know what happens to be happening.
When something is given a big cost that comes up with massive cost.
These are some incredible lists for <unk>
We can reduce the patient's difficulties from patients.
I wouldn't have to go to the clinic for the speed of routine.
With high-speed monitoring we could get a goals.
We could do a massive <unk> for clinical trials and for the first time, <unk> <unk> on a general.
We have the opportunity to start looking for the first <unk> of the disease before it's too late.
So by giving the first steps in that sense, we're launching the Parkinson's disease.
Along with <unk> and <unk> we want to record a lot of voices around the world to collect enough data and begin to address these goals.
We have local lines for about 750 million people in the world.
<unk> or without Parkinson's disease, you can call it low price and leave recordings for a few cents. And I'm pleased to announce that we've already reached six hours.
Thank you.   Tom Rielly: So let's get all these samples out of all of these samples of, say, 10 people, you can say who is healthy and who doesn't?
So what will you take from these <unk>
Max <unk> Yeah, yeah. What happens is that during the call you have to indicate if you have the illness, right?
<unk> You can see, some people can do not <unk> You may not know it.
But we're going to get a really big sample of <unk> data in different circumstances, and do it in different circumstances, it's important because we're looking at <unk> the crisis factors in pursuit of the actual markers of disease.
TR: You have a <unk> of accuracy at this time?
<unk> much more than that.
In fact, my student -- I have to have that <unk> has done a fantastic job, and now it has been demonstrated that works on the mobile phone network, too, what we <unk> the project -- now we have 99 percent accuracy.
TR: <unk> and nine. Well, it's a better.
<unk> Absolutely.
TR: Thank you very much. Max <unk>
<unk> Thank you, <unk>
Before March of 2011, I made <unk> in New York City.
We're <unk> creatures.
We <unk> ourselves in the darkness, in <unk> and usually we avoid the solar light.
We make thin models that are still more <unk> the perfect perfect skin -- we do the impossible -- and we can get into the press all the time, but some of us are really artists with talent with many years of experience and a real taste for images and photography.
On March 11, 2011, I saw from my home, just like the rest of the world, the <unk> events that were going on in Japan.
A few time later, an organization where it was voluntary -- and <unk> <unk> was in the place working as part of the answer.
I, with hundreds of other volunteers we knew we couldn't stay sitting in home, so I decided to join the group for three weeks.
On 13 of May I went to <unk>
It's a little <unk> village in the <unk> of almost 50,000 people, one of the first people affected by the wave.
The level of water recorded reached over 24 feet tall and more than three miles, the land.
As you can imagine, the village was <unk>
We spread rubble from the channels and the <unk>
<unk> schools. We removed the slime mold and leave the houses to be <unk> and <unk>
We took tons and tons of fish -- fish, <unk> from the local factory factory there.
We <unk> and we loved it.
For weeks, both volunteers like the neighbors found similar things.
They found pictures and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> cards.
They all did the same.
<unk> and bringing them to different locations of the people around the world for <unk>
It wasn't until I realized that those pictures represented a huge part of the personal losses that people had <unk>
As they were fleeing the wave, and to save their lives, they had to leave absolutely everything they had.
At the end of my first week I started to help in a center of the village.
It helped clean toilets -- gigantic giant toilets, giant <unk>
This place turned out to be also the place of the village where the center of <unk> <unk> the photos.
There were the <unk> and I had the honor for that day to be <unk> in me to clean the photos.
This was exciting and inspiring, had heard the expression beyond the <unk> but it was not until I was going through myself my horizons that something happened.
When you look at the pictures, I found some of them who had more than a hundred years old -- some of them were still in the lab, I couldn't avoid thinking about how to fix that <unk> and repair that <unk> and I knew hundreds of people who could do the same.
So that night he went on Facebook contacted with some of them, and the next morning, the answer was so overwhelming and positive, that I knew we had to try.
So we started <unk> the photos.
This was the first of all.
It was not too <unk> but where the water had <unk> the face of the girl I had to do with a lot of precision and <unk>
On the other way, that girl would not have the aspect of her, and that would be so tragic as having the <unk>
At the time of the time, they came up with the more pictures, and they need more <unk> so I went into Facebook and <unk> and five days later 80 people of 12 countries was offered to help.
After two weeks I had 150 people <unk>
In Japan, in July, we <unk> a village to Northern <unk>
Once the week we use our scanner in the libraries and temporal agencies that had been <unk> where people were going to reclaim their photos.
The time that <unk> in <unk> is a different story, depended on the <unk> of the photos.
It could take an hour. I could make a few weeks.
It could be a few months.
This <unk> had to draw practically by hand using the areas whose color and detail was not destroyed.
It took a long time.
The water destroyed all these pictures <unk> in seawater, covered with bacteria, with seaweed, even with oil -- all of it along with the step of the time, continue to be <unk> by hand was an important part of the project.
We couldn't afford the picture unless it was clean -- dry and had been <unk> by his <unk>
We had lucky <unk>
We have the guide for a neighboring <unk>
It's very easy to harm even more <unk> pictures.
As once he said, the leader of my group is like making a tattoo.
You can't make mistakes.
The woman who brought up these pictures was kind of lucky in relation to the photos.
He had started <unk> she himself but stopped when he realized that <unk> even more.
He also had <unk>
Without them, the images of his husband and his own face would not have been able to <unk> we were able to break the images in a single picture and make the whole picture.
When I picked up their pictures shared some of their story with us.
A few colleagues in his husband found the photos on a fire station between the rubble quite far from where he used to be his home, but his colleagues <unk>
The day of the tsunami -- his husband was the <unk> to give the barriers to the wave.
He had to go inside the water while <unk> <unk>
Their young children, not so small now, but their two kids were in school, in different schools.
One of them was trapped in the water.
He took a week to find every family and know that everyone had survived.
The day I gave his photos his youngest son <unk>
For that, despite all this, those pictures were the best gift that he could <unk> something that he could take back to look at, something that I could remember from the past that had not been tagged by that day of March when everything in his life changed or destroyed.
After six months in Japan -- 1,100 volunteers had been attached to them -- hundreds of them helped us to clean up to more than 80,000 photographs, the great <unk> -- the vast majority of their <unk>
More than 500 volunteers around the world helped us back to 90 hundred and hundreds of <unk> photos and <unk>
For this time, we really don't spend more than a thousand dollars in equipment and materials, most of them in ink to <unk>
We take pictures all the time.
A picture is a memory of someone or something, one place, a relationship, someone wanted.
They are <unk> of our memories and stories, the last thing we would use -- but the first thing we would take to look for.
This is about the project, of restore small pieces of humanity, to bring someone out with the connection to the past.
When a picture like this comes back to somebody, it's actually a huge difference in the life of the person who are <unk>
This project also made a big difference in the life of <unk>
Some of them connected to something bigger, to bring something, using their talent for something that are not going to be thin skin models.
In order to finish this email. I sent it up the day I came back from Japan after six months.
As I failed, I couldn't avoid thinking about people and the stories shown in the images.
One in particular a picture with women of different ages from the grandmother to the small girl, gathering around a baby, <unk> me because a similar picture of my family my grandmother, my mother, my mother, my mother, and my newly newly <unk> daughter.
In the whole world, in all the few of our basic needs are -- right?
Thank you.  <unk>
<unk> <unk> were inspired by awe and curiosity with this picture of a bullet that goes through an apple on a millionth of just a millionth of a second.
But now, 50 years later, we can go a million times faster and see the world not to a million or a billion, but a trillion frames per second.
I present to you a new kind of <unk> <unk> a new technique that can create videos in slow motion in motion.
And with that we can create cameras that you can see behind the <unk> beyond the line of vision, or see the inside of the body without using X-rays, and really challenging the idea of it.
If I take a laser pointer and I switch on and put it in a second or a second or -- in a number of <unk> to create a <unk> package.
And that package of photons -- that <unk> travel at the speed of light, and again, a million times faster than a common <unk>
If you take that bullet and this <unk> package.
What's the aspect of light in <unk>
Now, all of this --  Now remember that all this happens in less than a <unk> is what it takes to travel the light.
But this video is 10 billion times slower than you can see light in movement.
Coca-Cola is not <unk> this research.  <unk> a lot of things in this <unk> -- this information to show what is going on.
So the pulse, our <unk> enters the bottle with a package of photons that starts <unk> and that inside, it starts <unk>
Part of the light goes on the table, and we started seeing these <unk>
A lot of photons finally get to the cap and then explode in several directions.
As you can see, there's a bubble of air that bounces inside the inside.
At that time, the waves travel on the table and because of the insights in the top of the bottle, and after several boxes, that the insights were <unk>
Now, if we took a common bullet and current and we make it run the same distance and we see it in slow to about 10 billion times, how much you think it would take us to see that film?
One day? A week is not a year.
It would be a very boring movie --  from a slow <unk>
And what about doing with nature <unk>
You can see the waves that are <unk> from the table, the tomato wall.
It's like throwing a stone on a pond.
It's the way that nature paints a picture, I thought about a <unk> at the time, but of course, our eyes see a full composition of it.
But if you look at a more time this tomato -- you'll realize that, as the light gets <unk> of tomato -- it's still <unk>
Why? Because the tomato is <unk> and the light bounces on its interior, and it turns out to go out of several <unk> of a second.
In the future, when this <unk> is in your phone, you'll be able to go to the supermarket and check if the fruit is grown without having to <unk>
So why did we create this camera at MIT? MIT?
As usual, you know, if you take a picture on the low exposure, it enters a very little light.
But we will go to a billion times faster than the shortest <unk> so I can barely get some light.
We sent that <unk> that package of photons from times, and we recorded over and over again, with a very <unk> <unk> we took those <unk> data and <unk> <unk> to create those <unk> that I showed you.
We can take all those data in crude and make it interesting in a interesting way.
Superman can fly.
Other heroes can become invisible, other heroes can become invisible,
And if a new power of a future <unk> would allow you to see after <unk>
The idea is that we could throw a little bit of light on the door. You get into the room, a part is going to be on the door, and from the camera to the camera.
where we could extract those multiple <unk> of light.
It's not science fiction. We already built.
On the left, it's our <unk>
Behind the wall there is a <unk> and <unk> the light on the door.
After the publication of our paper in Nature <unk>
And a small fraction of the photons go back to the camera, but interestingly, in slightly different times.
And as we have a camera that works so quick, our <unk> has unique.
It's really good resolution and it can look at the world at the speed of light.
So we know the distances up to the door and also all the way up to the hidden objects but we don't know what point corresponds to the distance.
When I project a laser, you can record a picture in Stockholm, which you see on the screen, really doesn't make any sense.
But we will take a lot of images like this, tens of images, the <unk> and we will try to analyze the multiple <unk> of light, and with that, we'll be able to see the celestial object.
Can you look at <unk>
This is our reconstruction of it.
We have things to explore before we get this in the laboratory, but in the future, we could create cars that <unk> collisions with what is on the <unk>
Or we could look for survivors in dangerous conditions by looking at the open light through the open.
Or we could build <unk> that you can see the inside of the body through <unk> and the same for <unk>
But of course, because of the tissue and the blood is quite hard, so this is actually a request for scientists to start thinking about <unk> as a new visualization of visualization to solve the problems of mammography in the next generation.
So as <unk> <unk> himself a scientist, became an art science -- an art of photography pictures.
I realized that all of the data <unk> that we collect each time are not just for scientific <unk> but we can be able to be able to do that every single day.
We create a new form of computer photography with slow and light source.
And look at those waves Remember, the time between every one of those waves is just about <unk>
But here also something funny.
If you look at the waves under the <unk> these are going from us.
The waves should move toward us.
So what happens here?
It turns out that, as we are recording almost at the speed of light, we have <unk> effects.
The order of events that events in the world is sometimes <unk>
It would take the corresponding warping of space and time, we can fix this <unk>
That's time. Thank you.
Hello. This is my mobile phone.
A mobile phone can <unk> life, and it gives you individual freedom.
With a mobile mobile phone, a crime against humanity in Syria.
With a mobile phone, you can tweet a message and start a protest in Egypt.
With a mobile phone, you can record a song, and get it to <unk> and become famous.
This is all possible with a mobile.
I'm a <unk> of 1984 in the city of <unk>
So let's go back to this city.
So here you can see how hundreds of thousands of people are looking for a change.
This is the fall of 1989. Imagine if all of these people gathering them to go for a change in your pocket.
Who are you going to have a phone here?
<unk>
Raise your mobile phone, <unk>
<unk> A Android, a Blackberry, wow!
It's pretty much, almost everybody has a mobile.
But today I'm going to talk to me, from my phone, and how life changed my life.
I'm going to talk about this.
These are 35 <unk> of information.
<unk>
Why is that information there?
Because in the summer of 2006, the Commission of the E.U. presented a <unk>
<unk> <unk>
This directive says that every prison company, every <unk> of the entire Europe, has to store a wide range of information from the users.
Who calls <unk> who sends <unk>
Who is a text to <unk>
And if we use the phone, where we are.
All of this information is stored by at least six months, and to two years, in his phone company or his Internet <unk>
And in all Europe he stood and said, "We don't want this."
They said they didn't want this <unk>
We want the <unk> in the digital age, and we don't want the carriers and the Internet providers, all this information about us.
There was lawyers, journalists, they all said, "We don't want this."
And here you can see about 10 thousand people who went out to the streets of Berlin and they said, <unk> not <unk>
And some of them even said that this would be <unk>
<unk> was the secret police of East Germany.
And I also wondered if this really works.
Can you store all this information about us?
Every time I use the <unk>
So I asked my phone -- <unk> <unk> who at that time was the largest telephone company in Germany, who please give me all the information they had about me.
I asked once, and I went back to her, and I didn't get a concrete response. It was all <unk>
But then I said, I want to have this information because you are <unk> my life.
So I decided to make a lawsuit because I wanted to have this information.
But <unk> <unk> said no, we're not going to give you this information.
At the end, I <unk> a deal.
We will get the demand and they send me the information that I <unk>
Meanwhile, the Veterans' Court <unk> failed the <unk> for the German law of the E.U.
So I got this ugly <unk> on a <unk>
And on the CD there was this.
Thirty and five thousand pounds of information.
I saw them and I said, well, it's a huge file, OK.
But after a while, I realized it's my life.
There are six months of my life in this archive.
It was a little bit <unk> what did I do with that?
Because you can see where I am, where I step up the night, what I'm doing.
But then I said, I want this information <unk>
I want to make it public.
Because I want to show people what the retention of data.
So, next to <unk> <unk> and Open City, we did this.
This is a visualization of six months of my life.
You can go and zoom in, go backwards and forward.
You can see every step that I do.
And you can see how I'm going from <unk> to <unk> and how often I call it the way.
This is all possible with this information.
That gives you a bit of fear.
But it's not just me.
But of all of us.
First, there are things like, I call my wife and she calls me -- we talked a few times.
And then they call me some friends and they call it between them.
And then you call the other, and the other one another, and we end up with this big communications network.
You can see how your people communicate with each other to what time they call each other, what time to sleep.
You can see all this.
You can see the centers, the leaders of the group.
If you have access to this information, you can see what the society.
If you have access to this information, you can control your society.
This is a model for countries like China and Iran.
This is a model to study the shape of your society, because you know who speaks to whom, who sends an email to whom, -- all this is possible if you have access to this information.
And this information is stored at least six months in Europe, and to two years.
As I said at the beginning, imagine if all of these people in the streets of 1989, had a cell phone in my pocket.
And the <unk> had known who I was involved in this protest, and if the <unk> had known who the leaders, this had never happened.
The fall of Berlin Berlin might never have happened.
And a result, neither of the <unk> of <unk>
Because today, government agencies and companies want to store so much information of us as possible inside and out of the web.
They want to have the possibility of keeping our lives and they want to be <unk> forever.
But <unk> and living in the digital age, is not a contradiction.
But today you have to fight for the <unk>
You have to fight that every day.
When they return home to their friends that privacy is a 21st-century value of the 21st century, and it's not alive for fashion.
When you go to home, they went to the realization that just because companies and state agencies can store some information, don't have to do it.
And if you don't believe me, ask your phone company, what information they store from you.
So in the future, every time you use your mobile phones to give them to remember that you have to fight for the <unk>
Thank you.
Hello TEDWomen, what happens?
It's not enough.
Hello TEDWomen, what happens?
I call it <unk> <unk> and I'm not <unk> but I know the doctor that brought me to the world.
I went to my mom six times in six different different different directions.
As a result, I have cerebral palsy, which is why they were all the time.
<unk>
It's <unk> I'm like a mixture of <unk>
And Muhammad <unk>
<unk> isn't genetics.
It's not <unk> it can't be <unk>
No one <unk> the uterus of my mother and not <unk> because my parents were cousins, but they are.
It's just about accidents, like the one that happened to birth.
Now, I'm going to give you a source of inspiration. And I don't want any of them to be there.
It sits wrong for me, because at some time of life, you wish to be disabled.
Let's go for a walk.
<unk> at Christmas, are in the mall, driving in circles looking for parking lot and what do you look like?
16 empty places.
And they think, "God, I can be at least a little bit <unk>
In addition to I tell you, I have 99 problems, and the P. C is just one of them.
There is a <unk> of <unk> I would get the gold medal.
I'm <unk> Muslim women, disabled who live in New Jersey.
If you don't feel better, you might have to.
I'm from "Jurassic <unk> in New Jersey.
I always decided that my neighborhood and my condition had the same initial reaction.
I also love that if I want to walk from my house to New York, you can.
A lot of people with <unk> cerebral palsy, but my parents don't believe in <unk>
The mantra of my father was, "Can you get <unk> <unk>
If my three older sisters are <unk>
If my three older sisters were going to public school, my parents <unk> to the school system, and they were <unk> that I'm also out of it, and if we didn't take all of the final note all of my mother.
My father taught me to walk to the five years putting my <unk> in his feet and just walking.
Another approach I used was just just just hang a dollar in front of me so that I would get it.
The <unk> that I carry inside was very strong and ...
Yeah. The first day in the kindergarten was I was walking like a <unk> champion who has received many taps.
Growing up there was only six Arabs in my city and were all of the family.
Now there are 20 Arabic now, and they're still all of the family.  I think that nobody realized that we were not <unk>
This was before 9/11, and that the politicians would think appropriate to use <unk> to <unk> as a <unk>
The people who grew up with no problems with my faith.
But yet, it seemed to be a lot of <unk> that would die of hunger during the <unk>
I told them that I had enough fat to live three months without eating eating, so I came up from dawn at dusk is really easy.
<unk> <unk> in <unk>
Yeah, in <unk> It's crazy.  My parents could not afford the physical therapy -- so I sent to the dance school.
I learned to dance.
I'm from New Jersey, and there we want to be <unk> so if my friends were using <unk> me too.
And when my friends were going to spend the holidays in the coast of Jersey, I didn't go.
I spent my summers in a war zone, because my parents were afraid that if I won't go back to Palestine all the <unk> <unk> us in <unk>
On the summer week often my father was <unk> so I was drinking milk from <unk> so I was drinking hot cups on the back, I was going to lie on the <unk> Sea, and I remember the water <unk> my eyes and I thought, <unk> <unk>
But the cure cure was the yoga.
I must say that it's very boring, but before doing yoga is a comedian of <unk> that he could not stand up with <unk>
And I can put it on the head.
My parents <unk> this idea that I could do anything, that no dream was impossible, and my dream was to be in <unk> Hospital <unk>
I went to college, through the positive budget, and I got a scholarship for <unk> University of the state of Arizona, because it was in all the <unk>
It was like <unk> pet of the theater.
Everyone <unk> me.
I did all the tasks at least <unk> I took the top note in my lectures, and also in their classes.
Every time I took a scene out of the <unk> of my <unk>
But I never got a role.
Finally, in my last year, the <unk> decided to do a work called <unk> very slow in Jackson.
It's a work of a girl with brain palsy,
I was a girl with brain palsy,
So I started screaming at the four <unk> When I end up I finally have a <unk>
I have <unk>
I end up at the end of it.
Thank God <unk> I finally am <unk>
I didn't get the paper.  They gave it to <unk> Brown.
I went to <unk> running at the director of the theater, crying out, historically, as if someone would have killed my cat, to ask why and she said that because they believed that he could not do the stunts
And I said, <unk> if I can't do the stunts -- it can't do the <unk>
It was a paper that literally had been born and gave an actor without brain palsy,
College was imitating my life.
Hollywood has a <unk> history of <unk> actors who have no disabled players.
As I mentioned, I went home, and my first tour, <unk> was an extra thing in a <unk>
My dream became true.
And I knew it would be <unk> from <unk> friend <unk> <unk>
Instead, it was there as a <unk> I didn't look more than the <unk> and it was obvious to me that the soprano directors didn't make novel <unk> actors -- not white, with disabilities.
It just <unk> to perfect people.
But there was exceptions to the ruler.
I grew up watching <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and all these women had one thing in common: they were <unk>
So I made it <unk>
On my first tour, I took celebrity <unk> in New Jersey, and I will never forget the face of the first comedian that led when he fell in the realization that he was at high speed on the New Jersey <unk> with a driver that had a brain paralysis
I worked in clubs in the United States, and also in Arabic, in the Middle East, without <unk>
Some people say I'm the first <unk> of the Arab world.
I never like to reclaim the first place, but I know that they never heard that little rumor that says that women are not fun, and they find out very fun.
In 2003, my brother of another mother and father, Dean <unk> and I launched the Festival of <unk> <unk> in New York, now in his 10.
Our goal was to change the negative image of the <unk> in the media and at the time you remind the directors of which <unk> and Arabic is not <unk>
It was much more easy to fight the challenge of stigma for disabilities.
My great opportunity came in 2010.
I was just as invited by the radio program to go back with Keith <unk>
I went to a graduate dance, I went to a studio, and I sat in a wheelchair.
I looked at the director and said, <unk> can give me another <unk>
She looked at me and said, <unk> four, three, <unk>
And we were in <unk>
So I beat myself at the desk of the host for not going out on the screen during the <unk> and when I finished the interview, I was <unk>
I finally had my opportunity and <unk> I knew I wouldn't have been coming to me.
But not only Mr. <unk> went back to <unk> but he was just like <unk> and hit my chair.
Something funny that I learned in direct with Keith <unk> was that people on the Internet are <unk>
It tells you that kids are <unk> but they would never be <unk> from me and no longer <unk>
Suddenly, my disability on the Internet became an object of <unk>
We write videos on the line with comments like, "Why do you <unk>
"That's <unk>
And my favorite <unk> <unk> terrorist.
How <unk>
We really should pray for her."
One reviewer suggested I even would add my disability to my <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
disability is as visual as race.
If someone in the wheels, can't make <unk> then you can't make someone in a wheelchair.
The disabled are the <unk> Yeah, <unk> man.
The <unk> are the largest minority minority in the world, and the most <unk> in the world of entertainment.
The doctors said that I don't know, but I'm here in front of you.
And yet, having grown up with media, I don't think that <unk>
I hope that together we can create more positive images of disability in the media and in everyday life.
Maybe if there were more positive images, that would be less hatred on the Internet.
Or maybe no.
We probably need every society to teach good at our children.
My journey has led me to very spectacular places.
I came up with <unk> by the red carpet by the <unk> Susan <unk> and the infamous <unk> <unk>
I got to act on a movie with Adam <unk> and working with my <unk> the incredible Dave <unk>
<unk> <unk> <unk> have been <unk>
I was <unk> in part of the great state of New Jersey state in the <unk> of 2008.
And I founded <unk> a charity, an organization to give the Palestinians refugee kids -- a tiny little bit of what my parents <unk>
It was the only time my father watched me live alive, and I put this talk to his memory.
<unk> <unk>
I call it <unk> <unk> and if I can, you can do it too.
I'd like to tell you a story about a young town.
I don't know his name, but I know his story.
She lives in a small village to the <unk>
This people are near <unk>
<unk> propels the small village to poverty and the edge of <unk>
Without anything for him there, it's going to the great city, in this case, the capital of Somalia.
When you get there, there's no jobs, no matter of the future.
He just lived in a tent in the city outside <unk>
After maybe a year <unk> nothing.
One day you read about a gentleman who gives him to take it to <unk> after dinner, <unk>
He knows a dynamic group of people, which gives it a break.
She gets a little bit of money so that they bought new clothes, money to send their family home.
They present to a young lady.
They finally went home.
It starts a new life.
It has a life goal.
A beautiful day in <unk> under a blue skies <unk> a bomb.
That kid from that small village with the dreams of the great city was the terrorist terrorist -- and that <unk> group of people were <unk> a connected organization with the Qaeda.
So how do the story of a small child in a small village trying to get their dreams in the city ends up with he <unk>
He was waiting for him.
I was waiting for an opportunity, waiting to start his future, waiting for a future, and this was the first thing he arrived.
This was the first thing that got it out of what we call "the <unk> period.
And his story is repeated in urban centers around the world.
This is the story of the world's <unk> young American urban <unk> operating riots.
For the youth, the promise of the city, the great dream of the city is the opportunity of the opportunity, of well-being, but young people don't participate in the prosperity of their city.
It's often the youth who suffer from the highest rates of unemployment.
By 2030, three of every five people who live in cities will be under 18 years.
If we don't include young people in the growth of our cities, if you don't give them opportunities -- the story of the <unk> <unk> the door of access to terror, to violence, to be the history of Jewish cities.
And in my hometown of birth, 70 percent of the young people are <unk>
70 percent don't work, don't go to school.
They do nothing.
I went back to <unk> last month, and I went to visit the <unk> Hospital where I was born.
I remember being in front of that hospital <unk> to <unk> thinking, and if I had never gone?
And if I had had forced myself to be on that same <unk> of <unk>
I would have become <unk>
I'm not really sure of the answer.
The reason I was in <unk> that month was actually to house a few juvenile leaders in a business theater.
They went to about 90 juvenile leaders <unk>
We sat down and we had a rain of ideas about solutions to the great challenges facing the city.
One of the young people in the room was <unk>
He went to the University of <unk> <unk>
There was no job, no opportunity.
I remember when he said to me, because I was a graduate university college, I was the perfect white for Al <unk> and other terrorists, to be <unk>
They were looking for people like him.
But this story takes a different way.
In <unk> the biggest obstacle to get from point A to B is the streets.
<unk> years of civil war have completely destroyed the heat system and a motorcycle can be the easiest way of <unk>
<unk> saw an opportunity and <unk>
He started a <unk> company.
He started <unk> <unk> to local residents who were typically unable to <unk>
I bought 10 <unk> with the help of his family and friends, and his dream is at some moment to expand to hundreds of <unk> over the next three years.
Why is this story different.
So what does this story do?
I think your ability to identify and harness a new opportunity.
It's the corporate spirit and I believe that corporate spirit can be the most powerful tool against the <unk> of <unk>
They gave young men to be the creators of the economic opportunities that are looking for so much.
And you can train young people to be entrepreneurs.
I want to talk to you about a young man who attended one of my meetings, Mohamed <unk> a <unk>
He was <unk> to train some of the young people at the height of corporate skills and how to be innovative and how to create a culture of business initiative.
In fact, it's the first <unk> that <unk> has seen in more than 22 years, and until recently, until Mohamed came, if you wanted flowers to your <unk> <unk> we were of plastic from the abroad.
If you ask somebody, "When was the last time you saw flowers <unk>
For those of us who grew up during the civil war, the answer would be <unk>
So Mohamed saw an opportunity.
He started a <unk> company.
I created a farm on the outskirts of <unk> and started growing <unk> and <unk> who said, they could survive hard <unk>
And he started the delivery of flowers in order to create gardens in the houses, and the city companies and now is working in the creation of the first public park in 22 years.
There are no public parks in <unk>
It wants to create a space where the families, you can go together, and as he says, smell the pink roses <unk>
By the way, he doesn't wear a lot of water.
So the first step is to inspire young people, and in that room, the presence of Mohamed had a really profound impact on the young.
They had never thought about starting a business.
They had thought about working for an NGOs, working for the government, but his story, actually had a strong impact on them.
They forced them to look at his city as a place of opportunity.
encouraged to believe that they might be entrepreneurs, that they might be <unk> of change.
For the end of the day, they had innovative solutions for some of the biggest challenges facing the city.
<unk> business solutions for local problems.
So, inspired young people and create an industrial spirit culture is really a big step, but young people need capital to make their ideas true.
They need to have experience and orientation in order to go through the development and put it out of their businesses.
They bring the young people with the resources that they need to do, <unk> the support that they need to move from conception to the creation, and create <unk> for urban growth.
For me, the business spirit is something else to start a business.
It's create social impact.
Mohamed is not just selling flowers.
I think it's selling hope.
Their Park, this is how it's called, when he is created, transform the way that people see their city.
<unk> I hired kids from the street to help rent and maintain <unk>
He gave them the opportunity to escape the <unk> of <unk>
These young entrepreneurs are having tremendous impact on their cities.
So my suggestion is, to turn young people in entrepreneurs, <unk> and eat their innovation, and they will have more stories about flowers and Parks of the Peace <unk> and <unk> of <unk>
Thank you.
I had about 10 years, and I went to <unk> with my dad in the <unk> <unk> area in the New York state in New York.
It was a beautiful day.
<unk> forest forest.
The sun would make the leaves <unk> like a <unk> and not going to be the way that we could -- we can almost pretend that we were the first human beings to step on that land.
We got to our camp.
It was a shed in a <unk> with a beautiful lake <unk> when I discovered something horrible.
Behind the shed was a <unk> of about four square meters with apple hearts and <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk>
And he was <unk> I was very angry and incredibly <unk>
The <unk> who were too lazy like to pull out what they thought that he was going to clean up their <unk>
That question went on with me, and it would be <unk> a little bit.
Who clean our <unk>
No matter how <unk> or where the <unk> <unk> <unk> who cleans our trash into <unk>
Who cleans our trash in Rio or in Paris, or in <unk>
So here in New York, the Department of clean <unk> our trash <unk> of waste and two thousand tons of <unk> every day.
I wanted to know as individuals.
I wanted to understand who that work.
So what does it feel like to use uniform and take that <unk>
So I started a research project with them.
I traveled on the trucks and walked for his pathways, and I interviewed people in offices and facilities throughout the city, and I learned a lot, but was still a <unk>
I needed a lot more.
So I started working like <unk>
Now not just traveling on the trucks. I get them <unk>
And he operated on the mechanical <unk> and <unk>
It was a remarkable privilege and incredible learning.
They all ask the smell.
It's there, but it's not as prevailing as you believe it, and in the days where it's very strong one will be <unk>
It costs a lot of <unk>
I met people who had worked on that for several years, and their bodies were still <unk> to the weight of taking over their bodies all the weeks.
It's also the danger.
According to the Bureau of Labor <unk> the waste waste is one of the most dangerous <unk> and I learned why.
You're going out and moving into traffic every day and they go all around you.
They just want to be <unk> so usually the driver is not paying attention.
That's really bad for <unk>
And also, the trash itself is full of dangers that often fall from the truck and cause terrible harm.
I also learned about the relentless of trash waste.
When you get out of the <unk> and you see a city from the back of the truck, you get to understand that the trash is like a force of nature itself.
It will never stop coming.
It's also like a form of breathing or circulation.
It's always going to be moving.
And it's also the stigma.
It seems to me that stigma is particularly ironic because I believe strongly that <unk> are the most important work in the streets of the city, for three reasons.
They're the first license of public health.
If you don't get rid of the waste in the efficient and effective shape every day, this starts to <unk> from their containers and their dangers inherent are threaten in very real ways.
We had <unk> for decades and centuries, they come back and begin to <unk>
The economy needs it.
If we can't get rid of the old one, we don't have space for the new thing that the motors in the economy are going to fail to fail when it's in danger of consumption.
I'm not advocating for capitalism, I'm just pointing its relationship.
And then it's what I call our average speed necessary.
I mean just at the speed that we get used to move in the time <unk>
We usually don't care about it, and we didn't take it off, or we took our coffee cup -- our stock market, our water bottle.
We use them -- the <unk> we forgot about them, because we know that there's a job force on the other side that would take away from it.
So today I want to suggest to you a couple of ways of thinking about waste waste that maybe help reduce the stigma and <unk> in that conversation about how to design a sustainable and human city.
His work, I think, is almost <unk>
They are on the street every day, <unk>
They use a uniform in many cities.
You know when you are."
And their work allows us to make our own.
It's almost a form of relief.
The flow that they keep us from us from ourselves, from our own <unk> our <unk> and that flow must always stay in one way or another.
One day after September 11, 2001, I heard the <unk> of a waste harvesting on the street, grabbed the stairs <unk> and there was a man doing his journey of recycled paper as I did all the <unk>
And I tried to thank you for doing his work that day in particular -- but I started crying.
And I looked at me and just <unk> and said, "We're going to be okay.
We're going to be right."
Little after that, I started looking at the waste collection and I went back to see that man.
It's called <unk> we work together many times and we made good friends.
I want to believe that <unk> was right.
We're going to be okay.
But in our efforts for <unk> the way we exist on this planet as a species we have to include and have to account for all the costs, even the very real human cost.
The city waste we think when we talk about trash are three percent of the number of waste in the nation.
It's a remarkable.
So in the flow of their days and your life, the next one that you see someone whose work is cleaning you, <unk> a moment for <unk>
Let me give you a moment to tell you.
My work focuses on the connection of thinking about our communal life forming part of the environment where architecture produced naturally from the conditions and local traditions.
Today I brought two recent projects like this.
Both projects are sitting in emerging countries, one in Ethiopia and the other in Tunisia.
They also share the fact that different analysis from different perspectives become an essential part of the final work of architecture.
The first example started with an invitation to design a commercial center of several stories in the capital of Ethiopia, Addis <unk>
This is the kind of building that showed us as an example, to my team and me, about what we needed to designing.
Early on, the first thing I thought was, "I want to get out of <unk>
After I saw some of these buildings there are many in the city that we realized that there are three important aspects to <unk>
In principle, these buildings are almost empty because they have very large stores where people can't afford to buy things.
Second of all, you need to use a lot of energy because it is that the coating coating generates heat in the interior, so you need a lot of <unk>
In a city where this shouldn't happen because it's a temperate climate that goes from 20 to 25 degrees across the year.
And thirdly, it looks like nothing to do with Africa or Ethiopia.
It's a worthy of a place so rich in culture and traditions.
In our first visit to Ethiopia, was really enchanted with the old market that is this structure in the free air where thousands of people, go and buy things every day to little <unk>
There is also that idea of using public space to generate external activity.
So I thought, that's what I really wanted to design, not a commercial center.
But the question was how to build a modern building of several stories applying these principles.
The next challenge is presented to the <unk> the website, which is located in a very much area growth area where most of the buildings we now see in the picture, not exist.
And it's also between two parallel streets that are not being traded in an extension of hundreds of feet.
So the first thing we did was create a connection between these two streets, putting all the inputs in the building.
And this is spread with a <unk> <unk> which creates a space to the free air in the building that was <unk> by its own shape, of the sun and the rain.
And around this space, we've applied the idea of the market with little business, which changes on every floor because of the form of space.
I also thought, how do we bridge the building?
I wanted to find a solution that supports the local climate conditions.
And I got to think about a tissue similar to a <unk> beetle's shell.
And then we get inspired by these beautiful buttons in the <unk> <unk>
They have properties of fractal geometry and this helped me to model it.
We're building that with these little pieces of <unk> which are the windows that leave the air and light in a controlled way inside the building.
This is <unk> with these little crystals of colors that use the light from the inside of the building to illuminate the building at night.
With these ideas it was not easy to convince developers because they thought, "That's not a commercial center. It was not what we are."
But we all realized that this idea of the market was going to be much more profitable than the commercial center.
And also the idea of the whole side was a lot more economic -- not only because of the material compared to the glass, but also because it no longer had to have air conditioning.
So we get certain savings in the budget we use to implement the project.
The first thing was to think about how to achieve the power of energy for the building in a city where electricity goes almost every day.
So we got a great advantage by applying <unk> on the roof.
And then under those panels we think on the roof as a new public space, with areas of meeting and bars that would create this oasis.
And these <unk> on the roof, which is actually collecting water for the <unk>
It's expected for the early year, because we go through the fifth floor of the facility.
The second example is a master plan for 2,000 apartments and services in the city of Tunisia.
And to do a big project, the biggest thing that I have designed, I needed not only to understand the city of Tunisia, but also their own environment, his tradition and culture.
During that analysis, I put attention in the <unk> a structure of 1,000 years old that was surrounded by a giant wall of online access.
When I went to the place, the first design operation that we did was extend the roads, and creating 12 similar initial blocks in size and features that are in Barcelona and other cities of Europe with these <unk>
In addition to that, we selected some value points in relation to the idea of <unk> doors with straight lines, and this will change the initial model.
And the last operation was to think of the cell, the little cell cell looks like the apartment, as an essential part of the master plan.
I thought, what would be the best orientation for an apartment in the <unk>
And it's <unk> because it creates a thermal difference between both sides of the house and therefore a natural wild.
So let's make a framework that makes sure that most of the apartments are perfectly <unk> in that direction.
And this is the result that is almost like a combination of the European block and the Arab city.
It has these blocks with <unk> and then in the lower plant, we have all the connections for the pedestrians.
And it also responds to local norms that they set greater density on higher levels and a lower density on the lower floor.
And it also reinforces this idea of doors.
The roof, which is my favorite part of the project is almost like giving the community to the community full of the space.
It's where all the neighbors, you can go up and get them out and do activities, and do activity like running a race of two miles in the morning, or jumping from a building to another.
These two examples, have a common approach to design process.
And also, they're in emerging countries, where you can see cities literally grow.
In these cities, the impact of architecture in the life of people change communities and local economies at the same rate as the buildings grow.
So for this reason, I see even more important to look at architecture looking for simple solutions, but <unk> that improve the relationship between the community and the environment and the environment that have to connect nature with the people.
Thank you very much.
When I was eight years old, a new girl joined our classroom. It was as remarkable, as you see all the new girls.
It had great <unk> of very bright hair, and a little <unk> of cute. It was so hard for the capitals of the states, very good for <unk>
I ended up that year and I was full of jealousy, until I took my own plan.
One day I stayed for a time after the lunch line. I was a little bit late and I hid in the bathroom.
When the coast was <unk> salt I went in the classroom, I went from my teacher grades.
And then, I did.
I would take the ratings from my <unk> just a little bit, just a few things.
All the way --  And I set up to bring the book into the <unk> but to see, some of my other partners had really good notes as well.
So in a <unk> <unk> the notes around the world, no imagination.
I put them all rows from <unk> and myself a row of it, just for being there, because I would be there.
I'm still surprised what I did.
I don't understand how the idea.
I don't understand why I felt good at it.
I felt important.
I don't understand why I never <unk>
It's that everything was obvious to me.
I will never be surprised.
But above all, I know the reason why I was feeling that this little little girl, so small to <unk>
I will give me jealousy.
They're so <unk> and so <unk>
We know that babies suffer from jealousy.
Also the birds are very <unk>
We know that <unk> are the number one cause number one of America's <unk>
And yet, I've never seen a study that <unk> the loneliness, or the long length or the sadness.
So you have to go to the fiction, because these novels are like the lab that you are studying <unk> in all of their possible ways.
In fact, I don't know if it's an exaggeration to say that if there was no <unk>
Well, I wouldn't have <unk> <unk> I wouldn't have <unk>
There would be no king <unk> or <unk> and a <unk>
There's no Shakespeare.
I put up the reading lists of high school, because we would be losing "The <unk> and the <unk> would not have <unk> no <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk>
No offense to <unk> I know it's fashionable to say that <unk> has the answers for everything, and as soon as the legacy is almost that you have all.
This year is 100 years of his labor <unk> "In the <unk> of the <unk> the most <unk> study of sexual <unk> and also the ordinary <unk> and the whole thing that we might have.
We think in a kid trying to reconcile the dream.
We think of a <unk> <unk> in <unk>
We forgot how hard that image.
We forgot how relentless it is.
I mean, it comes from books that Virginia <unk> said they were as hard as <unk>
I don't know how the cat <unk> but we suppose it's <unk>
Let's look at why well together, the novel and the <unk> the <unk> and <unk>
It will be very obvious as the consumers who are reduced to the person, to their desire, to their <unk> are a good narrative base.
I don't know. I think we got very close to bone, when we think about what happens when we feel jealousy.
When we feel jealousy, we have a story.
A story about other people, and those stories make us feel terrible because they're designed for that, to make us feel bad.
Being the <unk> and audience, we know exactly how much <unk> to <unk> the knife right?
The <unk> do all novelists <unk> and that is something that <unk> understood.
Everything that she makes to give me just the other, maybe right now."
And it starts to say to the same story, and since then, <unk> says that every authentic truth, which <unk> detects in his lover -- it adds to his collection of torture in his private camera.
You have to admit that <unk> and <unk> were notoriously <unk>
You know, <unk> <unk> would have to leave the country, if they wanted to break with it.
But you don't have to be so <unk> to recognize that it's a tough job. Right?
<unk> are <unk>
Is it an emotion <unk> you have to get it out.
And how are the <unk>
<unk> are <unk> of information.
<unk> use the details.
The <unk> like the big <unk> of bright hair, and the nice little <unk> of <unk>
<unk> <unk> from the photos.
That's why Instagram is so successful --  <unk> links good language with the jealousy.
When you <unk> it is in its <unk> agony of soon listening to the doors and <unk> the <unk> of his lover then defends those behaviors.
He says, "Look, I know you think this is <unk> but it's not different from the interpretation of an old text or looking at a <unk>
He says, "It's a scientific research with real value.
<unk> is trying to demonstrate that the <unk> look <unk> and they make us seem like <unk> but in their <unk> are finding of knowledge, search for the truth, a truth of truth, and in fact, what to <unk> <unk> the more agonizing the truth.
<unk> <unk> <unk> These were the tracks to the wisdom of <unk>
He says, "A woman who we need -- that makes us suffer, it causes us a range of much more profound feelings and vital than a young man who can be <unk>
It's telling us that let's look for women.
No, I think it's trying to say that <unk> are telling us ourselves.
And there's some other emotion that makes us <unk> in this particular way.
There is some other emotion -- our <unk> our horrible ambition and our <unk>
Any other emotion that teaches us to look at with such a <unk>
Freud would write about this.
One day, Freud was visited by a very young young woman who was being used with the idea that his woman would be <unk>
And Freud said that there was some weird thing in that man, that he didn't get on what his wife.
Well, she was <unk> everybody knew it.
The poor creature was under no cause.
But he was looking for things that he made his wife, <unk> <unk>
<unk> <unk> or just accidentally <unk> with a man?
Freud said that man was becoming the <unk> of his wife.
The novels are really good at this.
<unk> describe very well how the <unk> make us look at intensity without precision.
In fact, the more intensely <unk> we are, more than fantasy.
And for this reason, I think, <unk> us to make violent acts or illegal.
<unk> lead us to behave in the whole range of ways.
Now I'm thinking about the age of eight years -- but I'm also thinking about this story that I heard on the news.
A woman from 52 years of age was captured by having created a fake account on Facebook from the one that would be sent <unk> <unk> itself, for a year.
For a year. Every year.
She was trying to <unk> the new girlfriend of his former boyfriend. I have to say, when or this, reacted with <unk>
Because, let's be realistic.
How big if you take creativity. Right?
It's like <unk>
Like a Patricia <unk> novel.
<unk> is one of my favorites.
She is a very strange and bright character of American literature.
It's the author of <unk> in a <unk> and "The <unk> Mr. <unk> <unk> books that try to how the jealousy, <unk> our minds, and once we are in the sphere, in the kingdom of the jealousy, the membrane that separates what it might be, can be <unk> in a moment's moment.
Take Tom <unk> his most famous character.
Tom <unk> goes from <unk> or want what you have to take out of your self and find out what you ever did, and it's under the floor <unk> your name, takes your rings, empty your bank accounts.
It's a way.
But what do we do? We can't take the route of Tom <unk>
I can't give you all the world, both as much as I wanted to.
It's a shame, because we live in the time of envy.
We live in times of jealousy.
I mean, we're good citizens of social media, where the currency is <unk> right?
<unk> show us <unk> I'm not sure.
So let's do what the characters are always doing when they're not sure, when you're in the mystery.
Let's go to <unk> <unk> Street and ask by <unk> <unk>
When people think about <unk> think about <unk> <unk> in Professor <unk> that criminal genius.
But I've always been <unk> <unk> <unk> the chief face of <unk> <unk> which needs to be <unk> <unk> needs the <unk> genius but bothers it.
Oh, it sounds so <unk>
<unk> needs your help, but it <unk> and <unk> and <unk> with <unk> in the decline in the mysteries.
But how do they work together, something starts to change, and finally in "The <unk> of the Six <unk> once they <unk> in, you go back to all with your solution, <unk> back to <unk> and say, "We're not <unk> Mr. <unk>
We are proud of <unk>
And he tells you that there's no person in <unk> <unk> I wouldn't want to hold your hands up.
It's one of the few times that we see <unk> relocated in history. It looks like this very emotional -- that scene is also mysterious, right?
It seems to deal with them as a problem of geometry, no emotion.
You know, in a minute <unk> it's the opposite side of <unk>
The next side are the same side.
Suddenly, I <unk> it allows you to admire that idea of being the <unk>
It could still be so simple?
What if <unk> are really a matter of geometry, just a question of where we allow ourselves to be in relation to that?
Well, maybe we don't have to get away from the excellence of the other.
We can do it with it.
But I like <unk> <unk>
So while we're hoping that happen, let's remember that we have the fiction <unk>
Only fiction <unk> jealousy.
fiction used to be invited to the table.
And look at what <unk> the sweet <unk> the terrifying Tom <unk> the crazy <unk> which was a terrible <unk>
We're in great company.
Thank you.
We used to solve big problems.
On July 21, of 1969, Buzz <unk> jumped outside the <unk> <unk> of Apollo 11 and landed on the Sargasso Sea.
Armstrong and <unk> were themselves, but his presence in the gray surface was the culmination of a collective process.
The Apollo program was the largest decline in times in American history.
In order to get to the moon, NASA has been about 180 billion dollars of today, or four percent of the federal budget today.
The Apollo gave up to about 400,000 people asked about 20,000 companies, universities and government agencies.
People died, including Apollo Apollo one.
But before the Apollo program, 24 men went to the moon.
<unk> walked on its surface, which he found after death death last year, is now the most <unk>
So, why are we <unk>
They didn't have brought a lot of <unk> pounds of old rocks, and something that the 24 <unk> later, a new sense of <unk> and the fragility of our common home.
Why do you <unk> The cynical answer is that the president Kennedy wanted to demonstrate the <unk> that this nation had better rockets.
But the English words in the University of Rice <unk> give us a better idea.
John F. <unk>
Why turn it in our <unk>
And they could also ask, why is climbing the most <unk>
35 years ago, why will fly on the <unk>
Why is Rice <unk>
We choose to go to the moon.
We choose to go to the moon.
We choose to go to the moon in this decade, and do other things, not because they're hard but because they're hard.
Jason <unk> For the <unk> -- the Apollo was not just a victory of the West over the Cold War.
At the time, the most strong emotion was the most strong emotion was <unk>
They were because it was something great to be able to do it.
The landing on the moon happened in a long list of <unk>
The first half of the 20th century produced the assembly line and the plane, penicillin and the vaccine for tuberculosis.
In the half of the century, it was <unk> <unk> and removed smallpox.
Technology seemed to own what Alvin <unk> in 1970 called <unk> <unk>
For most of the human history of humanity, we couldn't go faster than a horse, or a boat with it, but in 1969, the crew crew flew about 40,000 miles -- / hour.
Since 1970s, no human being has returned to the moon.
No one has traveled faster than the crew of Apollo 10, 10, and <unk> optimism about the power of technology has been <unk> by looking at that problems that we imagined technology would solve as to go to Mars, create a clean energy, cure cancer, or feeding the world population seem to have been <unk>
I remember seeing the Apollo <unk>
I was five years old, and my mother told me that I didn't go to the <unk> tube tube -- the rocket.
I knew I know that this would be the last mission to me, but I was completely sure that I would get to see colonies on Mars.
So that of "Anything happened to our capacity to solve problems with <unk> has become a common place.
We heard it all the time.
We've heard it for the last two days here, at TED.
It looks like the way if the technologists would have <unk> and they had enriched toys, things like <unk> apps and social networks, or algorithms that speed the sale <unk>
There's nothing bad at most of these things.
They've extended and enriched our lives.
But they didn't get the great problems of humanity.
What happened?
There's an explanation in the Silicon Valley, in Silicon Valley, which <unk> that have been created less ambitious companies than <unk> from the years where we can get together Intel and Apple and <unk>
Silicon Valley says that markets are the guilty, in concrete, incentives that venture capitalists offer entrepreneurs.
Silicon Valley says that the risk risk caused by creating the creation of ideas that are due to <unk> or even false problems.
But I don't think that this explanation is good enough.
It's mostly going wrong in <unk> Valley.
Even when venture capitalists were at their high point without caring for the risk, they were small investments than they could go out in 10 years.
<unk> have always had problems to invest in technologies as energy, that they need a huge capital and development that is in the long term.
No, the reasons why we can't solve the big problems are more complicated and profound and profound.
Sometimes, we don't solve the big problems.
We could go to Mars if you are."
NASA even designed a plan.
But go to Mars would take a political decision that was popular, and that will never happen.
We're not going to go to Mars because everybody thinks there are more important things to do on Earth.
Sometimes, we can't solve the big problems because political systems fail.
Today, less than two percent of the world's energy consumption is from renewable sources of renewable energy as solar and wind and <unk> Less than two percent, and the reason is completely cheap.
The coal and natural gas are cheaper than solar and wind, and oil is cheaper than <unk>
We want sources of choices that can compete at price.
Now, technologists, entrepreneurs and economists agree about what policies and international treaties -- the development of an energetic energy, <unk> a significant increase in research and development of energy, and some kind of control of the price of carbon.
But there is no hope in the current political climate now, that we'll see an energy energy policy or international treaties that reflect that consensus.
Sometimes, the big problems that seemed technological, they will not be.
We know since that famines are a result of failure in the food loop.
But 30 years of research have taught us that famines are political crisis that affect the distribution of food.
Technology can improve things like crops or systems for the storage and division of food, but there are bad governments.
Finally, big problems sometimes <unk> a solution because we don't understand the problem.
The president <unk> I declared the war on the cancer in 1971, but soon we discovered that there are many kinds of cancer, some terribly resistant to the treatment, and only over the last 10 years they seem to have found more effective and viable.
The hard problems are difficult.
It's not true that we couldn't solve problems with technology.
We can do and we have to do -- but these four elements have to be <unk> the political leaders and the population must want to want to have to solve the problem, the institutions must support <unk> because we have to understand it.
The mission <unk> that has become something like a metaphor for the capacity of technology to solve great problems, it serves those criteria.
But it's a model model in the future.
We're not in <unk>
There is no <unk> competition like in the Cold War, there's no politician like John Kennedy who <unk> the hard and dangerous, and there's no mythology of science fiction like exploring the solar system.
In general, go to the moon turned out to be easy.
I was just three days.
And really, it wasn't even <unk> no problem.
We're alone in our present, and the solutions of the future will be more difficult to get.
God knows that we're not missing the challenges.
Thank you very much.
Well, I'm going to talk about confidence, and I'm going to start with <unk> ideas that have been about trust.
They're so common that they've become <unk> of our society.
I think it's three.
The first one is a big decline in trust, there's been a very widespread belief.
The second is a goal: we should have more trust.
And the third is a <unk> we should regain trust.
I think the <unk> the target and the task has been <unk>
What I'm going to try to tell you about today is a different story about a <unk> a target and a task, which I think gives you a more clear idea about it.
First, the <unk> why do people think that trust has <unk>
And if I think about the basis of my own <unk> I don't know the answer.
I will bow to think that there might be <unk> in some activities or institutions, and that could have increased others.
I don't have that.
But I can go to the polls of mind, and the opinion polls are supposedly the source of the belief that trust has decreased.
When you look at the opinion polls over time, there's no lot of evidence.
I mean, the people who were <unk> 20 years ago, mostly journalists and politicians, they follow <unk> the same <unk>
And the people who were very reliable about 20 years ago, they still have a lot of <unk> judges, nurses.
The rest of us are in the middle, and by the way, the average citizen.
But this is really enough?
What we're looking at are of -- of course, opinion.
So what else can you do?
So what you're looking at are the <unk> attitudes, that people work when they get certain questions.
<unk> in the <unk> <unk> in the <unk>
Now, if someone asked you, <unk> in the <unk>
<unk> in the <unk>
<unk> in the <unk> teachers.
I probably would be able to ask by asking, "To do what?"
And that would be a very exciting response.
And you could say, when you have answered your question, "Well, I trust some, but in other no."
What's very rational.
In fact, in real life, we tend to make the confidence <unk>
We don't suppose that the level of confidence we're going to feel for a certain kind of official official or a guy who is going to be uniform in all cases.
I might, for example, I trust an elementary teacher who I know to give you the kind of reading, but no way to drive the school <unk>
After all, I could know that it was not a good <unk>
I could trust my fellow <unk> to keep a conversation, but no, perhaps, to hold a secret.
Simple.
And if we have those evidence in our day-to-day lives in the way that trust is <unk> why we leave it all of that knowledge when we think of trust as much as we think of trust <unk>
I believe that surveys are very bad tools to measure the real level of real trust, because they try to give them the good inherent judgment of doing anything or somebody.
Secondly, what about the <unk>
The goal is to have more trust.
Frankly, I think it's just stupid.
This is not the goal that I <unk>
I would have more confidence in what is <unk> of trust, but not what it isn't.
In short, I'm <unk> of not trust which is not reliable.
And I think that those people who are <unk> their savings with the very <unk> named Mr. <unk> who then disappeared with them, and I think, well, they were too <unk>
Having more confidence is not a intelligent goal in this life.
They were deposited or <unk> with intelligence, that's the right target.
Once you say, yes, OK, that means that what matters in the first place is not trust, but trustworthiness.
What's about making a judgment on how reliable people are in certain ways.
And I think to be able to do a trial, we're forced to focus on three things.
They're <unk> They're <unk> They're <unk>
And if you find that one person is <unk> in the <unk> states, and it's responsible and honest, then we'll have a really good reason to trust her, because it's going to be worthy of trust.
But yes, on the other hand, they're not responsible -- we couldn't trust them.
I have friends who are <unk> and honest, but not <unk> in them to take a letter to the email, because they're <unk>
I have friends who are really sure that you can do certain things, but I see that they would take their own <unk>
And I'm really happy to say that I think I don't have a lot of friends who are <unk> and responsible but extremely <unk>
If it's like that, I still haven't been <unk>
But that's what we're going to do is that we know before you trust.
The confidence is the answer.
<unk> is what we have to be <unk>
And of course, it's hard.
In the last decades, we've tried to build the systems of accountability for all kinds of institutions, professional officials and officials and others, that we made us more easy to judge their reliability.
A lot of those systems have had the opposite effect.
They don't work like <unk>
I remember one time I was talking to a <unk> and he said, "Well, you see the problem is that it takes more time to make it <unk>
And we found the same problem in all of our public life, and <unk> that the system of accountability that is meant to guarantee <unk> and <unk> testing, actually is doing the opposite.
What they're doing is <unk> the work of the people who have to do hard tasks like the <unk> <unk> which are <unk> as we say.
I'm sure all of you know similar examples.
We put all of that, by the target.
I think the goal should be more <unk> and things that things would be different if we were going to be worthy of being worthy of trust, and <unk> people who are safe and whether other people, officials or politicians are worthy of trust.
It's not easy. It's the trial, the simple actions -- what you don't do properly.
Third, the task.
You go to the task to rebuild the confidence, puts things upside down.
It suggests that you and I should reconstruct trust.
Well, we can do it with ourselves.
We can reconstruct a little bit trustworthiness.
We can do it if they're two people, and trying to improve trust.
But trust is <unk> because they give them other people.
You can't reconstruct what other people have given you.
You have to give them the bases so you can trust you.
You have to be worthy of trust.
And that, of course, is because you can't get away by all people, all the time.
But you also have <unk> evidence that you're worthy of trust.
How do you do that?
That is done every day, everywhere, it makes people common -- the <unk> the institutions, very effectively.
I'll give you a simple commercial example.
The store where my socks on my socks says that I can get it without giving you a word.
I take you back and give me the money, or do they change them by the color that I want.
That's great. I rely on them because they were very vulnerable to me.
I think there's a big lesson in that.
If you become vulnerable to the other part, that's a really good proof that you're worthy of trust, and you have confidence in what you're saying.
So, in the end, I think that what we're pointing is not a really hard thing to do.
What people rely on is to relationships, and in that framework, you can determine when and how the other person is worthy of trust.
Thank you.
From the early computers we have been <unk> by reducing the separation between us and digital information, the separation between our material world, and the world of the screen in which the imagination can be <unk>
This separation has gone increasingly and more and more, to such a point that today is less than one millimeter, the thickness of a tactile screen, and the power of computing has become accessible to all.
But I ask myself and if I didn't have <unk>
I started imagining how you are."
I first created this tool that goes into the digital space, so that when the strong <unk> against the screen transfers its physical body to the side.
Designers can <unk> their ideas directly in 3D, and surgeons can practice with virtual organs underneath the screen.
So with this tool break down the barriers.
But the two hands remain still on the screen.
How do you get to the inside and interact with digital information using the whole dexterity of the hands?
In the division of Sciences <unk> of Microsoft, along with my mentor <unk> <unk> <unk> the computer and transformed a little bit about the keyboard in a computer area.
It would take a transparent bombsight with cameras with deep cameras to detect the fingers and the face, now you can raise the hands of the keyboard, and get into the inside of the 3D, and grab pixels directly with your hands.
Like the windows and archives have a location in real space, it's so easy to grab a book from a <unk>
You can flip through the book and pull out lines or <unk> or words with the virtual tactile sensor that is down on every floating screen.
Architects can stretch or rotate their models directly with their hands.
In these examples, we were <unk> in the digital world.
And if we invest the papers and we make digital data to us?
And so many of us will be able to buy and returned things on the Internet.
Now that doesn't have to worry about.
What I have here is a virtual <unk> on the Internet.
This is the vision that you get from a flat device on your head or <unk> when the system is understanding the geometry of your body.
If we take this idea further, I thought, instead of just looking at pixels in space, how we can make it physicists so that we can <unk> and <unk>
How would a future look like?
At the MIT Media Lab with my <unk> Ishii, and my collaborator <unk> Post, we created this only physical matrix.
This imam <unk> acts like a pixel in 3D space, which means that both the computer can move to any place inside this small three-dimensional space.
<unk> what we did was we <unk> gravity and control the motion through a combination of <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk>
And by designing the object, we release it from the restrictions of time and space, which means that human movements can <unk> and go back to <unk> and stay in the physical world.
You can teach <unk> physically and distance and the famous shot of Michael Jordan, you can play it as a physical reality that we want to.
Students can use it as a tool to understand complicated concepts like the movement of planets, the physics, and, unlike <unk> or textbooks, this is a real and palpable experience, this is a real and palpable experience.
But what is more fascinating to change the physics of the computer is to imagine how to program the world is going to change our physical activities.
As you can see, digital information is not just going to show us something but will start acting directly on us as part of the physical world that surrounds us without us to have to move into our world.
We started the talk today about a barrier, but if you take that barrier, the only limit that is left is our imagination.
Thank you.
It was <unk> to become a <unk> for two years in <unk> China, in the 1950s.
When I was in first grade, the government wanted to join a school for athletes for all the <unk>
But my tiger mother said, "No."
My parents wanted to become engineering, like them.
After surviving the Copernican Revolution, they believed strongly that there was just a slow way toward the <unk> a safe job and <unk>
No matter if the work I'd like or not.
But my dream was to be a Chinese Opera singer, of me.
This was me, in my imaginary piano.
One opera singer has to start <unk> from very young people to learn the <unk> so I tried everything I could to go to the opera school.
Until I wrote to the director of the school and the host of a radio.
But for any adult <unk> the idea.
No adult took me seriously.
Only my friends <unk> me, but they were kids, without authority, like me.
So at the age of 15 years, I knew it was too much bigger to train.
My dream was never <unk>
I would know that for the rest of my life a second class of second class was the only thing that could aspire to.
And this was so unfair.
So I solved another <unk>
No one around me wanted to <unk> OK.
We went to the books.
<unk> <unk> <unk>
Those who were <unk> in China, of course.
"The Good <unk> is about Chinese <unk>
And it's not propaganda its <unk>
The Bible is interesting, but strange to me.
That's a topic for another day.
But the fifth commandment for me was a <unk> <unk> your father and your mother."
<unk> I told me, "It's so different, and much better than <unk>
So it became my tool to get out of this <unk> <unk> <unk> and to start the relationship with my parents.
The encounter with a new culture also led to my habit of reading reading.
It would take a lot of perspectives.
For example, at the beginning this map seemed to me because this is what the students in China will learn.
I had never happened.
A map involves the perspective of people.
The comparative reading isn't something new.
It's a common practice in the academic world.
There are the research fields like religion and literature and literature.
<unk> and <unk> gives you a deeper understanding of a subject.
And I thought that if the comparative reading worked to research, why not do it as well in life.
So I started reading books from two.
They may be from <unk> <unk> of Walter <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> who were involved in a very <unk> or friends with <unk> experience.
For <unk> <unk> are economic and political and <unk>
For the Buddha, they are all <unk> lust, fear and the duty to <unk> Interesting.
If you know another language, it's also fun to read your favorite books in two languages.
<unk> <unk>
For example, it's through the translation that I realized that <unk> in Chinese literally means <unk> <unk>
And <unk> in Chinese, literally means <unk> mother."
The books opened up a magic door to deal with people from the past and the present.
I know I'm not going to feel used to be powerless before.
Having a dream -- it really is nothing compared to what many others have <unk>
I've come to believe that consciousness is not the only purpose of a dream.
Its most important purpose is to connect with the place that the dreams, where the passion comes from, where happiness.
Until a <unk> dream to do that for you.
And it's because of the books, which I'm here, happy, living again with purpose and clearly, most of the time.
So the books always <unk>
Thank you.
Thank you.
When I was in my <unk> I saw my first customer <unk>
I was a Ph.D. student in psychology at Berkeley.
She was a <unk> woman named <unk>
Alex I went to the first session using jeans and a British <unk> he threw on my office in my office and took the shoes and told me he wanted to talk about his problems with men.
When I heard this, I felt so <unk>
My class had a <unk> as a first customer.
And I got a <unk> who wanted to talk about men.
I thought I could handle it.
But I didn't did.
And with the <unk> stories that Alex brought the <unk> made me easy to move my heads while I would make the solution.
<unk> are the new <unk> saying, Alex, and so I saw her, she was right.
You start working on, you go home and have children later, until death goes on.
For <unk> like Alex and I had time for <unk>
But I got a little bit later, my <unk> <unk> to push me to Alex who would talk about his life <unk>
I get <unk>
I said, "Yes, he's coming out with a little bit under his category, <unk> <unk> but it's not like to marry him."
And then my <unk> said, "No, no, but maybe it would be <unk> with the next.
In addition to the best time to work on marriage marriage is before they were <unk>
This is what psychologists call a moment.
It was when I realized that <unk> are not the new <unk>
Yeah, people sit on the head after what they were <unk> but this didn't make the <unk> of Alex a pause in their development.
This made the <unk> of Alex were the perfect moment, and we were <unk>
So I realized that this kind of benign <unk> was a real problem and had real consequences, not just for Alex and his life life, but for careers, families and the future of <unk>
There are 50 million <unk> in the United States today.
That means 15 percent of the population, or 100 percent -- if you think of the age without spending before the <unk>
Raise your hand if you're in your <unk>
I want to see the <unk> here.
Oh yeah. They're amazing.
If you work with <unk> they love a <unk> you remove your dream a <unk> I want to see -- it's okay.
This is not just my opinion.
We know that 80 percent of the key moments in life.
This means that eight of every 10 decisions and experience, and transcendent moments that give your life to have been done for when they have 30 and <unk>
People from 40, not <unk>
This audience is going to be right, I think.
We know that the first 10 years of a race have an exponential impact on the amount of money that we have.
We know that more than half of the Americans are married, they live or they're coming out with their future partner.
We know that the brain ends up its second and last stage of growth in its <unk> and <unk> for <unk> which means that if there's something that you want to change from themselves, now is the moment to change themselves.
We know that the personality changes more times during their <unk> than any other time of life, and we know that the female fertility gets to the top of the 28 and things become complicated at the <unk>
<unk> are the moment to get them on their body and their options.
When we think about development of the kid, we all know that the first five years are crucial to language and attachment to the brain.
It's a moment where its daily life and common life has an impact on the person who will be <unk>
But what we don't hear often is that there's something called adult development and our <unk> are a critical moment in developing life.
But this is not what the <unk> are listening.
The newspapers talk about changes in the timeline.
The researchers call the <unk> an extended adolescence.
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk>
It's true.
As a culture, we have considered a <unk> which is actually the decade that defines the <unk>
Leonard <unk> said that to achieve great things, you need a plan, and not enough time.
It's not true?
What do you think happens when you give a <unk> on your head and say, "You have another 10 years to start your <unk>
There is nothing.
They stole that person the urgency of urgency and his ambition and it is absolutely nothing.
And then every day, <unk> intelligent, interesting like you or your children get to my office and say something like this: "I know that my boyfriend, is not good for me, but this relationship is not -- I'm just killing time."
Or say, "Everybody says that while I start a race before the 30, everything will be right."
But then it begins to sound something like this: "My dad <unk> are <unk> and I still have nothing to show you.
He had better robots, the day I graduated from <unk>
And then it begins to sound something like this: "My dad quotes during the <unk> were like the chairs.
They were all running, but then at some point around the 30, it turned out the music and all started sitting there.
I didn't want to be the only one who will be standing, so I sometimes think I married my husband because he was the closest chair when he had <unk>
Where are the <unk> here?
Don't do that.
Well, that sounds a little bit end, but you don't know the risks are very high.
When you leave a lot of things for the <unk> there's an enormous pressure on the top and so many of them start a career, to choose a city, pick a partner, and have two or three children in a long time period.
A lot of these things are not <unk> and there's some research that starts to show you, which is a lot more difficult and happily do everything from one time to <unk>
The middle-aged crisis is not about buying red <unk>
It's about showing you that you can't have the career you want now.
You know, you can't have the son you want now, or you can't give you a brother for your son.
A lot of <unk> and <unk> you see themselves, and me, sitting in the room, and they talk about their <unk> "What was you doing? What was you thinking?"
I want to change what the <unk> are doing and thinking.
Here's a story of how it might be.
It's a story about a woman named <unk>
On the 25, Emma came to my office because it was, in his own words, having an identity.
He said that I'd like to work in art or in the entertainment, but you still can't decide, so I spent the last few years working as a <unk>
As it was cheaper, it lived with a boyfriend, which was more <unk> than ambition.
And even though they live a few very hard <unk> his previous life had been even more difficult.
It would be often in our <unk> but then it would raise herself to say, "You don't choose your family, but you can choose your friends."
Well, one day Emma got his head on his legs and cried for almost the entire hour.
I was just going to buy a new book for <unk> and I had spent the whole morning with his lots of contacts, but then he was looking at the empty space that follows after the words in the words, please call it <unk>
I was at the point of <unk> when he looked at me and said, "Who is going to be for me if I have a <unk> accident.
Who is going to take care of if you give me <unk>
At that point, I had a lot of hard work to resist and I don't say, <unk>
The thing that Emma needed was not a <unk> that really was <unk>
Emma needed a better life, and I knew that this was his opportunity.
I had learned a lot since I worked with Alex as to just sit while the 1950s.
So, over the next few weeks and months, I told Emma three things that all <unk> or woman, deserves to know.
First of all, I told Emma that was <unk> from that identity crisis and <unk> of identity.
For our identity capital, I mean to do something that add value to your person.
Doing something that is an investment in what you want to be next.
I didn't know the future of the race <unk> and no one knows the future of work, but I know this: capital of identity creates identity.
So now it's time for that work on the other side of the country, from that company that you want to try to try.
I'm not <unk> exploration, I'm looking at exploration that I shouldn't be able to count, which, by the way, is not exploration,
It's <unk>
I told Emma that I would explore work, and I would make them count.
Second of all, I told Emma that urban tribes are <unk>
The best friends are great for you to take you at the airport, but the <unk> who come together with friends with similar minds just as long as you know, how you know how to speak, how to speak, and where they work.
That new piece of capital, that new person who comes out of almost always comes out of the closest circle.
The new things come from what they're called young friends friends of their friends.
Yeah, half of the <unk> have a bad job or no work.
But the other half no, and the weak links are the way that we get to this group.
Half of the work had never been <unk> then, knowing the boss of your neighbor is the way you get a job of a job.
It's not cheating. It's the science of how information is going on.
For last but not least, Emma thinks that you don't choose your family, but I know their friends.
This was true when I was growing, but as he said, Emma soon <unk> her family, when he has a partner and it exists his own family.
I told Emma time to choose his family had come.
Maybe you think that 30 is better time to sit head than 20 or even 25 and I agree with you.
But to choose the person who you live now or tell you now when everybody on Facebook are going to walk towards the <unk> is not progress.
The best time to work in your marriage is before you have, and that involves being so intentional in love as you are in the job.
<unk> your family must be a conscious choice of who and what they want rather than just to do that are going to work or kill time with whom you are <unk>
So what happened to <unk>
Well, we looked at that <unk> and she found a young cousin of a cousin who was working on an art museum,
This weak <unk> helped get a job there.
That offer of work gave a reason to leave the boyfriend, who live alive.
Now, five years later, it's <unk> special of events in museums.
This married a man who chose <unk>
<unk> his new career, love, his new family, and I sent a letter that said, "Now the spaces of emergency emergency room are not sufficiently enough.
The story of Emma may sound easy, but that's what I love to work with <unk>
It's very easy to help you.
<unk> are like planes coming out from the Airport Airport who go somewhere in the West.
Right before the <unk> a light fits on its trajectory makes the difference between land in Alaska or in <unk>
In the same way, to the age of 21, or 25 and even <unk> a good conversation -- a good job, a good TED Talk can have enormous effects in the years or even in the next generation.
Here's my idea of spreading all the <unk>
It's as simple as I learned to say to <unk>
This is what I now have the privilege of telling <unk> as Emma every day -- the <unk> are not the new <unk> <unk> their <unk> get your <unk> to get their ties -- get their links to your family.
They're not going to be defined by what they didn't know or what they didn't know.
They're deciding their life today.
Thank you.
When I was 27 years old, I left a really hard job for a job that was even more <unk> <unk>
I went to teach them mathematics at seventh grade students in the public schools.
And like any professor, I applied tests and evidence.
I gave them assignments.
When the job comes back, <unk> grades.
What struck me is that I.Q. was not the only difference between my best and my worst students.
Some of those who had a better performance had no test scores of <unk>
Some of my smartest kids were not going so well.
And that got me thinking.
The kind of things you need to learn in mathematics in seventh grade, sure, are <unk> <unk> <unk> the area of a <unk>
But these concepts are not impossible and was very convinced that every one of my students could learn the lesson if I worked hard and for time for time.
After several years more than <unk> I came to the conclusion that what we need for education is a better understanding of students and learning from a <unk> perspective from a psychological perspective.
In education, the only thing we know how to measure better ways.
It's the <unk> but what if you're successful in school, and life depends on much more than the ability to learn how fast to learn how fast to learn how fast to learn how fast and easy?
So I left classrooms and went to college, to become <unk>
I started studying kids and adults in all kinds of <unk> scenarios and every study my question was, who has success here and why?
My research team and I went to the <unk> West <unk>
We tried to predict what <unk> <unk> in the military training.
We went to the National <unk> and we tried to predict what kids were going to do as much possible in the competition.
We studied teachers working in neighborhoods working in really hard -- what teachers are still teaching for the end of the school school and from <unk> who will be the most effective in improving the outcomes of their <unk>
We partnered with private companies, ask yourself, which of these <unk> are going to keep their job <unk>
And who is going to make more money?
In all those contexts very different contexts emerged from a feature as an important success of success.
And it wasn't social intelligence.
It wasn't the good look, physical health, and it was not <unk>
It was purpose.
<unk> is passion and perseverance to achieve long-term goals.
<unk> is to have a resistance.
<unk> is clinging to its future, day after day, not just for the week, not just for the month, but for years and working really hard to make that future a reality.
<unk> is to live life as if it was a <unk> not a race.
A few years ago, I started studying determination in the public schools.
I asked thousands of high school students who did my questionnaires of determination and then waited for about more than a year to see the people who were <unk>
It turns out that children with more determination had significantly greater chance of <unk> even when the <unk> in every single feature that I could measure -- things like family income, the scores of <unk> testing, even the security that they felt when they were in school.
So it's not only in West Point or in the National <unk> of <unk> where purpose.
For me, the most powerful thing about determination is how little we know, how little people know the science of its development.
Every day, parents, and teachers ask me, "How do I make responsibility for kids?
What do I have to do to teach kids a good job ethic.
How do I keep the motivated <unk>
The most honest answer is, I don't know.  What I know is that talent doesn't give them purpose.
Our data shows very clearly that there are lots of talented individuals who just don't go ahead with their <unk>
In fact, in our data, the commonly determination is not related to that or it's even related to the category of talent.
Up until now, the best idea I've heard about developing the determination for the children is something called <unk>
This is an idea that was done at Stanford University for Carol <unk> and it's the belief that the ability to learn is not fixed, that can change with effort.
Dr. <unk> has shown that when kids read and learn about the brain and how it changes and grow in response to the challenge, they are much more likely to <unk> when you die, because they don't think that failure is a permanent condition.
So the mentality of growth is a great idea to develop purpose.
But we need more.
And that's where my speech, because that's where we are.
That's the work we have to go.
We need to take our best ideas, our strongest intuitions and we need <unk>
We need to measure whether they have been successful and we have to be willing to fail, to make them fail, to start to start to start to start all over new with the <unk>
In other words, we need to be certain about making our kids more <unk>
Thank you.
<unk> in Taiwan like the daughter of a <unk> one of my most <unk> memory, is my mother <unk> the beauty and the form of the Chinese characters in the way.
From that time, I was going through this incredible language.
But for a overseas, it seems to be as <unk> as the Great Wall of China.
In the last few years, I've been asking if I can break down this <unk> so that I know that I want to understand and appreciate the beauty of this sophisticated language I can do it.
I started thinking about how a new method of learning Chinese can be useful.
Since I was five years old, I started learning how to draw each of the traces of every character in the right sequence.
I learned new characters every day for the next 15 years.
So we only have five minutes, it's better than we do it in a faster and straightforward.
A Chinese academic <unk> 20,000 characters.
You just need a thousand to understand basic literacy for it.
The first 200 of them will allow me to understand 40 percent of the basic literature, long enough to read the signals of traffic menus to understand the basic idea of the web pages or newspapers.
Today I will start with eight to show you how the method.
Are you ready?
Open your mouth as much as possible until it is <unk>
They get a mouth.
This is a person who's going to take a walk.
<unk>
If the form of fire is a person with your arms in both sides, as if I was shouting in a <unk> way, <unk> I'm <unk> This symbol is actually <unk> in the form of called, but I like to believe it's the other way.
This is a tree.
tree.
This is a mountain.
The sun.
The moon.
The <unk> symbol looks like a couple of <unk> <unk> in the old West.
I call these eight characters.
They are building blocks for them to create a lot of more characters.
One person.
If someone walks behind, that's <unk>
As old said, two are company, three are a company, three are a crowd.
If a person stretch your arms, this person is saying <unk> that big.
The person inside the mouth, the person is <unk>
It's a prisoner's like <unk> inside the whale.
A tree is a tree. Two trees together, we have a woods.
Three trees together, we also have the woods.
Put a table under the tree, we have the foundations of it.
Put a mouth on the tree -- that's a <unk>  <unk> of remember, because a satellite tree, is quite an idiot.
Remember fire?
Two chemicals together, it becomes very warm.
Three species together, that's a lot of fire.
Put the fire under the two trees, that's <unk>
For us, the sun is the source of prosperity.
Two <unk> together.
Three together, those are <unk>
Put the sun and the bright moon.
It also means morning, after one day and a night.
The sun comes out on the horizon.
A door. Put a table inside the door, it's the <unk> of the door.
Put a mouth inside the door, asking questions.
<unk> I got somebody at home?
This person is coming out of a door, <unk> <unk>
On the left, we have a woman.
Two women together, are <unk>
Three women together, have <unk>
So we've been for almost 30 characters.
When I use this method method, the first eight <unk> will allow them to build 32.
The next group of eight characters would build other 32.
So with every little effort, you're going to be able to learn a couple of hundreds of characters who are the same thing that you learn a Chinese.
So after knowing the characters, we started creating sentences.
For example, mountain and fire together, we have a mountain of fire. It's a <unk>
We know that Japan is the sun <unk>
This is a sun in the <unk> because Japan is in China.
So a sun next to the beginning, we created Japan.
One person behind Japan, what do we have?
A Japanese person.
The character on the left are two stacked mountains over the other.
In the old China, that meant in <unk> because Chinese <unk> <unk> their political enemies beyond the mountains.
Today, the exile has become a date.
A mouth that tells you where to go out is an exit.
This is a slide to remind me that I have to stop talking and just the stage. Thank you.
What I prefer to be my dad is the films I get to see.
I love to share my favorite films with my <unk> when my daughter was four years ago, we saw the magician, of Oz together.
The movie is mastered his imagination for months.
His favorite character was <unk> of course.
He gave a good excuse to wear a bright dress and lead a magic pen.
But when you see that movie so many times, you get to understand that it's extraordinary.
We now live and raise our children in a kind of industrial complex of childhood fantasy.
However, the magician, the magician was an event in itself.
It didn't start that trend.
The trend actually took 40 years later with, interestingly, another film, whose <unk> a <unk> kid and a young boy <unk> a girl dressed as a guard of the enemy.
You know what I'm talking about?  Yes.
There's a big difference between these two movies, there's a couple of big differences between the magician, of Oz and all the films we see today.
One is that there are very little violence.
The monkeys are pretty aggressive, like <unk>
But I think that if the magician, the magician, the magician, the magician, the magician, say, <unk> you're the salvation of Oz like the prophecy.
It would be some magical shoes to defeat armies by <unk> from the evil <unk>
But that's not what happens.
Another one of the <unk> magician, is that the most exciting characters and wise characters are women.
I started looking at this when I did Star Trek -- a few years later, and the situation was different.
At that point, I also had a son.
three years old.
It wasn't invited to projection because it was still very small for that.
But it was the second son, and the level of oversight had <unk>  So, he slid into the room, and he was impressed as a mom with his <unk> behind, and I don't think he understood what was going on, but, you know, <unk> everything.
I wonder what <unk>
Would you be <unk> perseverance and <unk>
It would be the feeling that Luke one of the army to <unk> the government?
<unk> this with the magician.
How do he win Dorothy your film?
We do good <unk> with all and being a <unk>
This is the kind of world that I want my kids to grow up with them, OK?
Why is there so much force capital in the movies for our children, and so little on the road of <unk>
There is a lot of literature about the impact of male women in the girls, and they should be <unk> It's really good.
I haven't read so much about how kids react to this encouragement.
I know by experience that Princess <unk> didn't give me the right framework that would have served to navigate the world of adults who is <unk>  I think at the time of the first kiss I really expected the staff to appear because it's the end of the movie, right?
My quest is finished, I have a girlfriend.
Why are you standing there?
I don't know what I have to do.
The films focused on defeat the <unk> and get their reward, and they don't leave time for other relationships or other <unk>
It's almost like being a kid, you have to be a dumb animal, and if you're a girl, you have to wear a <unk>
There are lots of exceptions, and defend the <unk> of Disney to any of you.
But they send a message to the kids, even if you guys, they are not really their goal.
They do a phenomenal job by teaching girls how to defend the <unk> but they don't necessarily show kids how to defend from the <unk>
There's no model for them.
We also have some great women who write new stories for our children, as real and lovely and lovely as <unk> and <unk> but not stop being a war movies.
Of course, the most successful subject of every time continues to come up with classic <unk> every one of them about the adventures of a child or a man, or two men who are friends, or a man and the two men who have a little girl.
Until many of you are thinking about this year, eventually it came out.
I recommend all of you. It's already available in shops.
Remember what the criticism said when he came out.
I can't believe that Pixar is made a movie of a <unk>
It's very good. Don't let that <unk>
Well, almost none of these films is the test of <unk>
I don't know if you heard about this.
It's still not just <unk> and it's already <unk> but maybe we're going to start a movement.
<unk> <unk> is a book artist, and in the late 1980s, I recorded a conversation that had had a conversation about the assessment of the films that you saw.
And it's very simple. There are only three questions that must be <unk> in the film, there are more than a female character than you have lines?
So, you have to get <unk>
These women are talking to each other at some point in the film?
Their conversations are about something more than the kid who are so much like <unk>  All right? Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.
Two women who exist and talk about things each other.
<unk> I've seen it -- and yet, very rarely I see it in the cinema that we know and love.
In fact, this week I went to see a very good quality movie, <unk>
Right? <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> a sense of consensus of what is a Hollywood Hollywood <unk>
<unk> not the test of <unk>
And I don't think that <unk> because a lot of the movie, I don't know if you've seen it, a lot of the movie happens in a embassy where men and women were hiding during the <unk>
We have a lot of people who have deep conversations and painful conversations in this <unk> and it's the great time for one of the actors to take a look at the door and say, <unk> to bed, <unk>
This is Hollywood.
So <unk> in the numbers.
In 2011, from the 100 most popular films how many people believe that they have artists have <unk>
<unk> It's not bad.
It's not the same percentage that the number of women have chosen recently for Congress, then it's okay.
But there's a larger number than this is going to be <unk> this room.
Last year, The New York Times published a study that the government had done.
This is what he would say.
In the United States, one in five women, one in five women says it's been sexually assaulted once in their life.
I don't think it's the fault of mass entertainment.
I don't think that films for children have something to do with that.
I don't think that music videos or pornography are closely <unk> but something is wrong, and when I listen to that statistician, one of the things I think is that there's a lot of sexual <unk>
Who are those <unk> What's <unk>
What do you not get <unk>
They are <unk> the story that says that the role of a male hero is defeat <unk> with violence, and then charge the reward, which is a woman who has no friends and not <unk>
We are <unk> that story?
You know, as a father with the privilege of raising a daughter like those of you who are doing the same, we found this world and this very startling statistic and we want to <unk>
We have tools to our willingness like <unk> <unk> and we hope that <unk> but I have to ask, <unk> <unk> if at the same time, active or <unk> we are educating our children to keep their power <unk>
I mean, I think the Netflix list is a way to do something really important, and here I mean primarily to the parents.
I think we have to show our children a new definition of <unk>
The definition of man is changing radically.
You've got to read about how the new economy is changing the role that looks after home and <unk>
Everything is changing.
When I asked my daughter what he was his favorite <unk> character -- you know what you are."
<unk>
<unk> <unk> and <unk>
What's in common these two?
Maybe it's not just a brilliant glowing pen.
I think they're experts.
I think these are the two people in those films that know more than anyone, and they love their knowledge with other people to engage their potential.
They're leaders.
I like that kind of stories for my daughter, and I like that kind of stories for my son.
I want more stories like that.
I want to make a little bit of stories where I tell my <unk> Go and struggle with only and more stories where their job is to join a team -- maybe a team led by women, to help other people better and better people, like the magician <unk>
Thank you.
As a girl, I was living in Maine, and one of the things that I was most like was looking for the sea cookies.
But you know, it's hard to find these <unk>
They're covered with sand and it's hard to see them.
And yet, over time, I went to <unk>
I started looking at shapes and patterns that helped me <unk>
This became a passion for finding things, in a love for the past and <unk>
And finally when I started studying <unk> I realized that I see with my own eyes was not enough.
Because, suddenly, in Egypt, my little beach in Maine had grown up to one of almost 1.3 miles of length with the <unk>
And my sea fortune had grown the size of cities.
This is really what led me to use satellite images.
So to try to make a map of the past, I knew I had to do it differently.
I want to show you an example of how different we see when we use the <unk>
This is a place in the eastern delta in Egypt called <unk>
And of course, in simple view, it seems to be brown, but when we use infrared and process it using fake color, suddenly the place looks like pink rose as glowing <unk>
What you're looking at are the actual chemical changes of the landscape caused by the materials of building and the activities of the ancient Egyptian.
I want to share with you how we have used satellite data to find an old American city called <unk> missing for thousands of years.
<unk> was the old Egypt for over 400 years in a time period called the Middle Empire about 4,000 years ago.
The place in <unk> Egypt, and it's really important because in the Middle East, there was this great renaissance of old art, architecture and religion.
<unk> have always known that <unk> was located somewhere near the pyramids of the two kings that <unk> <unk> inside the red circles here, but somewhere inside this huge <unk> <unk>
This area is huge, it's about roughly <unk> for <unk> kilometers.
Before, <unk> right next to <unk> and as it changed over time, moved into this and covered the city.
So how do you find a city <unk> on a <unk> landscape.
And I'm going to be able to get the <unk> would be the equivalent of looking for a needle in a <unk> with the eyes <unk> and using baseball.
So we use data NASA data to make a map of place, very subtle changes.
We were able to see where the <unk> <unk>
But you can see more <unk> and it's even more interesting -- this little bit more interesting -- this slightly high area that looks inside the circle here, that we think it could be the location of <unk>
So we collaborate with the Egyptian scientists doing the job jobs, you can see it here.
When I say <unk> it's like the shots of it shows in ice, but instead of layers of climate change -- we look for layers of human occupation for the human occupation of it.
Five meters down, below a broad layer of mud, we found a dense layer of <unk>
That means that in this possible location of <unk> five meters down, we have a <unk> layer of a number of years that date from the Middle East, exactly the same period as we think it's <unk>
We also found <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> and <unk> what proves that there was a <unk> shop.
This might seem to be a lot, but when we think about the most common stones used in the jewels of the Middle East, these are the stones that are <unk>
So we have a dense layer of occupation that goes back from the Middle Empire in this place.
We also have evidence from an elite jewelry shop. which proves that what has been there, was a very important city.
We still don't find out <unk> here, but let's go to the place in a near future for <unk>
And even more importantly, we have the resources to train young Egyptians in the use of satellite technology so they can also perform great discoveries.
I want to end up with my favorite quote from the Middle East, probably <unk> about 4,000 years old.
Let me share knowledge is most of all the <unk>
There's nothing like that on the ground.
So apparently TED was not founded in 1984 by 1984 <unk>
Do the ideas actually started in 1984 in 1984 in a missing city not for a long time, not for a long time, and found from the high.
It certainly puts the search for <unk> in perspective.
Thank you very much.
Thank you.
I want to invite you to close your eyes.
So imagine standing out of standing in front of the door of <unk> home.
I want you to pay attention to the color of the door, the material that's made.
Now let's go through a group of obese <unk> on a bikes.
They are competing on a race bike race and go in the direction of their <unk>
I need you to see this <unk>
They're <unk> strong, they're <unk> they're <unk>
And they collide from front against the door of their house.
There are bicycles in all the way -- wheels, so it goes on the top of the wheels, that end up in <unk> places, the threshold of the door.
In the lobby, or what there is the other side of the door, and watch the quality of the light, the light shining on the <unk> of <unk>
He's waving with the hand.
From his chair, on a brown horse.
It's a horse that's talking about.
You can feel your blue <unk> <unk> on your nose.
You can smell the <unk> <unk> and you go to the point of getting in the mouth.
I went through a side and trained their living room.
In the room, and doing the most of their imagination -- imagine Britney <unk>
It's with little clothing, dancing over his center of the center, singing <unk> <unk> One More <unk>
Now let's go to the kitchen.
The ground has been covered with a yellow brick road and from the oven. They come to you and <unk> the <unk> <unk> and <unk> of <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> of the hands, <unk> to you.
Okay. Open your eyes.
I want to tell you about a peculiar contest that is conducted every spring in New York.
It's called the <unk> of the United States."
I went to cover this event a few years ago as a <unk> journalist. I suppose, that this would be like the end of a <unk> <unk>
There were several men and a few ladies and different ages and different habits of hygiene.
They were <unk> hundreds of numbers -- let's look at them just once.
You know, the names of tens and tens of strangers.
It took whole poems in just minutes.
<unk> to see who he could memorize the highest order of a deck of <unk>
And I was like, "This is <unk>
These people must be phenomena of nature.
And I started talking with some of the competitors.
This one is a man named Ed <unk> who had come from England, and he has one of the best <unk> memories.
I asked her, when you realized that you were a <unk>
Ed replied, "I'm not a wise.
Actually, I have an average memory.
Everyone who participate from this competition say they have normal memory.
We have trained to do these miraculous acts of memory using a old memory of old old techniques, invented 2,500 years old in Greece, the same techniques that used <unk> to memorize their narratives and the <unk> <unk> used to memorize <unk>
And my reaction was: How do I not hear about this <unk>
We were standing outside the hall of competence, and <unk> who is a wonderful and bright and <unk> although a little <unk> said to me, "You are a American journalist.
You meet Britney <unk>
And I said, "What? No, why?
"Because I would like to teach Britney <unk> how to memorize the order on a deck of playing on national TV.
That would prove to the world that anybody can do it."
And I said, "Well, I'm not Britney <unk> but maybe you can teach me to me.
I mean, you have to start for something not?"
And that was the beginning of a very strange journey for me.
I ended up going through most of the next year -- not just training my memory, but also <unk> trying to understand how it works, why sometimes it doesn't work, and what can be their potential.
I met a lot of really interesting people.
This is a man named <unk>
He's <unk> very likely with worst memory in the world.
Her memory was so bad that I didn't even remembered that he had a <unk> problem.
Someone who was incredibly tragic, but it was a window that allowed to see until what our memory are makes us who we are.
On the other end of the spectrum, I met this man.
This is Kim <unk> He was based on the role of <unk> <unk> in the movie <unk>
We went one afternoon in the public library in Salt Lake City, <unk> <unk> was <unk>
And by coming back, I read a lot of treaties on written memory, something more than 2,000 years ago in <unk> in <unk> and then in the Dark Ages.
And I learned a lot of really interesting things.
One of the most interesting things I learned is that there was a time where this idea of having a disciplined and disciplined memory and <unk> was not such a rare thing as it might look today.
A long time, people invest in their memory, to provide their minds.
These techniques have made our modern world, but they also have changed.
They have changed <unk> and I would say that they have changed any cognitive change.
As we almost don't have to remember, sometimes it seems that we have forgotten how to do it.
One of the last places in our planet where you are still passionate about this idea of a disciplined and disciplined memory -- is this very singular competition of memory.
It's actually not so <unk> there are skills like this.
I was <unk> I wanted to know how these people do.
A few years ago, a group of researchers at College College invited a group of memory, the lab.
So they wanted to be brains in some way, <unk> or <unk> different from the rest of us?
The answer was, no.
Are you smarter than <unk>
They gave them a battery battery -- and the answer was actually not.
There was no really interesting and significant difference between brains of memory champions and the subject of control with the <unk>
When they put them on a <unk> MRI machine, your brains while <unk> numbers, faces and forms of snow.
They <unk> or they seemed <unk> a part of the brain that involves spatial and navigation and navigation.
Why? There's something we can learn from this?
The tournament for <unk> <unk> is running as an armed race where every year has a new way of remembering more things, and then the rest of the competitors must get a day.
This is my friend Ben <unk> three times a memory.
On his desk, in front of him, there are 36 <unk> of cards, which he is about to try to memorize an hour by using a technique that he invented and that only <unk>
He used a similar technique to memorize the precise order of <unk> digits <unk>
In half hour. Yeah.
And while there is a lot of ways of remembering things in these competence, absolutely all of the techniques used to the end of the first concept that psychologists call <unk> <unk>
It illustrates with a elegant paradox known as the <unk> <unk> <unk> says, <unk> I call the same word. I say to you. <unk> there's a man named <unk>
That's its <unk>
And then I ask you, <unk> that there's a <unk>
And when I went back later, and I asked them to <unk> that word that I told you about a <unk>
I guess what <unk>
The person who was told that his name is Baker is unlikely to remember the same word that the person who was told that his job is <unk>
The same word, different capability.
What about here?
Well, the name is, it doesn't really mean for you. It's no relationship to you.
With all the other memories they are dancing for their head.
But the word, <unk> We know <unk>
They use <unk> hats.
They have <unk>
They worked well when they come home to work.
It probably would be some <unk>
And when you take that word for the first time, we started putting <unk> <unk> for <unk> <unk> at some point back.
One of the most elaborate techniques to do this dates back to Greece <unk>
It's known as <unk> <unk>
The story says this: There was a poet named <unk> who went to a <unk>
They had hired it like entertainment, because before before, if you wanted to give a really good cocktail party -- you don't get a <unk>
He stood up, he stood up with his memory memory, and he <unk> and so soon it was, the room of <unk> <unk>
<unk> everyone.
But not only killed each other, but it ripped out the bodies.
No one could say who was there, no one could remember where you were sitting.
So they wouldn't be able to get the <unk>
A tragedy behind the other.
I stopped standing out of standing out of <unk> only <unk> in the middle of the rubble, closed the eyes and realized that with the eyes of his mind, I could see where I had been sitting on every time.
It took the family of the hand <unk> where their loved ones were in the rubble.
What you have to do is pick up at that moment is something that we all know more or less <unk> and it is that no matter if we're not good at remembering names or phone numbers or instructions for the word of our colleagues, we have visual memory and spatial memory.
If I gave you the first 10 words of the history that I just told you about <unk> is very likely to be really hard to do it.
But I'm going to bet that if you asked them to say who sitting on the flat sleeping horse in his lobby, they would be able to <unk>
The idea of the memory of the memory is to create this building with the eyes of its mind and <unk> of images with the things that you want to remember.
This is a advice that comes from more than 2,000 years ago, to the first memory memory, in <unk>
And how does it work?
Let's say that you have been invited to the TED stage to give a talk and want to make memory of the same way that I would have done it -- if you were invited to <unk> 2,000 years ago.
What you might do is imagine that you're on the door of your house.
And to come up with some kind of image of a picture of absolutely <unk> crazy and <unk> to help us remember that the first thing that you want to mention is that completely <unk> competition.
And then you can imagine moving into your house, and see the <unk> of <unk> <unk>
And that would remind you that want to introduce your friend Ed <unk>
And then you would see Britney <unk> to remind you that funny anecdote that you want to count.
And then you start in the kitchen, and the fourth subject that they would talk would be that weird journey that did for a whole year, and they have some friends to help them remember it.
This is how <unk> <unk> their narratives -- not word for word, which is going to confuse you but typical by typical.
In fact, the term <unk> comes from the Greek <unk> which means <unk>
It's an absence of when people thought in <unk> and in the rhetoric with this kind of spatial terms.
The phrase <unk> first <unk> it would be like the first place in his memory.
I saw that this was just fascinating, and I got a full full of it.
So I went to some of these memory skills, and I had the idea of writing something long about this <unk> of <unk>
But there was a problem.
The problem was that a memory competition is a boring event.
But seriously, it's like looking at a lot of people sitting on <unk> I mean, the most exciting thing that happens is when someone got <unk>
I'm a journalist, and I need to be able to write about something.
I know that there are incredible things happening in the minds of these people, but I don't have access.
I realized that if I was going to tell this story, I needed to try to put myself in his place.
So I started spending 15 or 20 minutes every morning, before I sit to see the New York Times, just trying to remember something.
Maybe a poem. Or the names of an old <unk> school <unk>
And I discovered that this was fun.
I would have never expected it to do it.
It was fun, because it wasn't just to train the memory.
What it really is about doing is more and more more and more the ability to create and imagine these <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and I wish <unk> in the eye of mind.
I was really excited about this.
This is me, using my standard training team.
It's a couple of <unk> and a pair of security covered with tape, leaving only two <unk> because the distraction is the worst enemy of memory.
And I ended up coming back to the same contest that I had covered a year before, I had the idea that I could be able to get it into a kind of <unk> experiment.
I thought this could serve a good deal for my whole research.
The problem was that the experiment came out of control.
And I won the <unk> something I didn't have to happen.
Of course it's nice to <unk> narratives and numbers of phone and phone numbers, but actually this is not the point.
These are just so many <unk> tricks.
Because it's based on very basic principles about how the brain works.
And it's not necessary to build the memory of the memory or <unk> <unk> <unk> to benefit from a little bit of <unk> about how their mind.
We often talk about people with a great memory, as if it was a Catholic gift, but it's not the case.
The great memories were <unk>
At the most basic level, we remember when we pay attention.
<unk> when we focus deeply.
The palace, these memory techniques are just shortcuts.
In fact, they're not even <unk>
They work because they make them <unk>
It would take a kind of deep processing -- a kind of complete attention that most of them are not <unk> by there.
But the reality is that there's no shortcuts.
This is how things do <unk>
And if there's something that I want to leave you with today, is what I would do, the <unk> that I couldn't even remember that I had a memory problem, so I left me, which is the notion that life is the sum of our memories.
How much are we willing to lose what is already our short existence <unk> in the <unk> or <unk> not paying attention to the human in front of us, who is going to be so <unk> that we don't even care about processing in <unk>
I learned firsthand that there are incredible memory capabilities in all of us.
But if you want to live a life life, you have to be the kind of person that remember remember.
Thank you.
I'm going to talk to you about the last 30 years of the history of architecture.
It's a lot to cover in 18 minutes.
It's a complex subject -- so let's just get a little <unk> New Jersey.
Because 30 years ago, I am <unk> Jersey, I was six years old and lived there in my parents in a village called <unk> and this was my <unk>
In the corner, from my dorm room, I was the bathroom that I shared with my sister.
And between my dorm and the toilet, there was a balcony that gave the living room.
And there everybody passed the time looking at TV. So every time I went from my room to the toilet, everybody looked at me and every time I got <unk> and I would all see me.
And I was like that.
It was <unk> safe, and he hated it.
I went on that journey, hated that <unk> hated that room and that house.
That's architecture.
<unk>
And those feelings, those emotions that I felt, that's the power of architecture, because architecture is not about mathematics, and no division of zones, but from those connections that are <unk> emotional connections that we feel in the places that are <unk>
And no wonder that I feel like that way, because according to the Environmental Protection Agency spend 90 percent of their time under roof.
I mean, 90 percent of the time we're surrounded by architecture.
That's so much.
architecture determines in ways that we don't even take place.
That makes us a little naive and very, very predictable.
This means that when I show you a building like this, I know what you are thinking about <unk> <unk> and <unk>
And I know that they think about it by based on a building built 2,500 years ago by the Greeks.
This is a trick.
It's a <unk> that architects use to create an emotional connection to the shapes that we build our buildings.
It's an emotional connection -- we've used this trick for a long time.
We use it 200 years ago to build banks.
We use it in the 19th century to build art museums.
And in the 20th century, in the U.S., we use it to build home.
You know, these <unk> <unk> <unk> in front of the sea, far from the elements.
This is very, very helpful, because building things is terrifying.
It's expensive, it takes a long time, and it's very complicated.
The people who are <unk> the <unk> and governments are always afraid of innovation, and they have to use ways that you know they're going to work.
So we found buildings like this.
It's a nice <unk>
This is the Public Public Library.
But it doesn't have a lot to do with a library today.
That same year, in 2004, the other side of the country, was finished another library, which looks like this.
It's in Seattle.
This library shows how we use media media in the digital era.
It's a new kind of equipment for the city, a place to come up, reading and to share.
So how is it possible that in the same year, in the same country, two buildings, both so-called libraries, are completely different?
And the answer is that architecture works in the beginning of <unk>
On the side of the side, the architects constantly drive new technologies to bring new technologies for the forms of life today.
We gave them and gave them so much, we get away from the people.
All of the black -- you know, you think we feel really good, but we're dead because we have no choice.
We have to go on the other side and get to connect with those symbols <unk>
So we do that, and we're all happy, but we are all happy, but we feel like <unk> So we start to experiment with <unk> we do it swing the back of the back and over and over again, and so we've done it in the last 300 years, and of course it is, in the last 30 years.
Well, 30 years ago, <unk> from the '70s.
The architects were busy experimenting with the so-called <unk>
It's got to do with concrete.
That can be guess.
<unk> small <unk>
Something really hard.
So we get to the '80s, and we began to bring those symbols.
Let's get the start in the other direction.
We take those forms we know that like and <unk>
It <unk> and we added <unk> and we use new materials.
They love it.
We don't take <unk>
We take <unk> <unk> and turn them into a skyscraper, that can be <unk> <unk> <unk>
The shapes were <unk> won in boldness and <unk>
<unk> became columns.
<unk> grew up to the size of buildings.
<unk>
But the 1980s, that was great.
We all spent the time in commercial schools, we moved to the neighborhoods, and there, in the suburbs, we can create our own erotic <unk>
These fantasies could be <unk> to French or the Italian.
You may have a <unk> <unk>
This is what happens with the <unk>
This is what happens with the symbols.
They're easy, because they're cheap, because instead of creating new spaces, we recreated memories of other places.
I know very well, and you all know that this is not <unk>
This is Ohio.
Architects feel frustrated and we started making a swing in the other direction.
In the 1980s and early '90s, we started to experiment with the so-called <unk>
We have the symbols <unk> we now have new design techniques, <unk> design techniques, and we find out with new <unk> a way that would be <unk> against other ways.
This is <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and it's <unk>
Normally the <unk> <unk> in the opposite direction.
But then something <unk>
In 1997, this building.
It's <unk> <unk> <unk>
This building changed fundamentally the relationship of the world with architecture.
Paul <unk> said that Bilbao was one of those rare times when academic <unk> and public and public and public and public and public and public and public and public and public and public and public and public and public and public and public and public and public and public and public and public and public and public and public and public and public and public and public and public
The New York Times <unk> this <unk>
The tourism in Bilbao grew up in a half a half a half a half a half percent.
So all of a sudden, everybody wanted one of those <unk> Los Angeles, Seattle, Chicago, Chicago, New York, <unk>
Everyone wanted one, and Gehry is everywhere.
He was our first star.
But how is it possible that these <unk> and <unk> ways, how is it possible that it will become ubiquitous around the world?
And it happened, because the media is <unk> around them, and we quickly learned that those forms were culture and <unk>
We created an emotional reaction to these ways.
They did the major mayors in the world.
So everyone believed that if they had these forms, they had culture and <unk>
This phenomenon in the beginning of the new millennials with other architects star.
He went to <unk> and <unk> and what happened with these few elite architects at the threshold of the new millennium, actually started moving through all of architecture, digital media began to increase the speed of information.
Think about it, for example, how you use architecture.
A thousand years ago, you'd have to walked up to the next village to see a building.
<unk> <unk> can take a boat, a plane, can be <unk>
<unk> technology, you can see on the paper, on TV, and finally, we're all photographers in architecture, and the building is carried beyond its physical location.
Architecture is everywhere right now, that means that the speed of communications has reached the speed of architecture.
Because architecture moves so quick, so quickly.
It doesn't take long time to think about a building.
It takes a lot of time to build a building, three or four years, and at that time, an architect can design two, eight, or 100 more buildings before knowing if that I designed four years ago was a success or not.
Because there's never been good feedback in architecture.
That's how we found buildings like this.
<unk> was not a <unk> movement, but 20 years old.
For 20 years, we were building buildings like this because we had no idea how much the <unk>
That's never going to happen to happen, because we're at the threshold of the biggest revolution in architecture from the invention of steel or <unk> and it's the media revolution.
My theory is that when you apply the self to the media, start swing more and faster, until it's going to be in both extremes almost in <unk> and <unk> effectively the difference between innovation, and symbol, between us, the architects, and you, the public.
Now we can make symbols almost <unk> with emotional loads of something completely new.
I'm going to show you how the system works in a project that my company ended up recently.
We were <unk> to replace this building that was <unk>
This is the center of a village called <unk> in <unk> Island, in the state of New York.
It's a community on vacation.
But that meant that two years before the building, the building, was part of the community. And as the drawings looked at the exact product, not any surprises.
The building came to be part of the community. That first summer, when people began to get and shared it in social media, the building stopped being a building, it became a medium of communication, because these are not just images of a building, are the images that one made of the building.
And as you use it to tell your story, they become part of the personal narrative, and that makes it <unk> with the collective memory, and by bringing these symbols, we learn.
I mean, we don't need the Greeks tell us how to think of architecture.
We can tell each other what we think of architecture, because digital media is not only changed the relationship between us, but that changed the relationship between us and buildings.
Think for a second in those librarians of <unk>
If that building is built today, first <unk> to the Internet for <unk> <unk>
<unk> <unk> with examples of <unk> of innovation, about what a library might be.
That's <unk>
You can take the mayor of <unk> to the people of <unk> and tell you that there are no one answer to what is a library today.
Let's be part of this.
This abundance of solutions gives the freedom to experience.
It's all different now.
Architects are no longer those mysterious creatures that use <unk> and drawings and complicated, and one is not a <unk> public that doesn't take something that you have ever seen before.
Architects can listening, and you don't leave <unk> by architecture.
That means that the <unk> of one style to another, from a movement to another, is irrelevant.
In fact, we can go ahead and find appropriate solutions to the problems facing society.
This is the end of the history of architecture, and it means that the buildings in the morning will be very different than the buildings today.
This means that a public space in the former <unk> city can be unique and adapted to the measure of a modern city.
This means that a stadium in Brooklyn, can be that, a stadium in Brooklyn, and not a bad imitation of red brick of red brick with ideas of what it must be <unk>
This means that some robots will be able to build our buildings, because we'll finally be ready for the shapes that are going to make.
That means that buildings will be <unk> to the whims of nature and not the contrary.
This means that a parking garage, in Miami Florida, can also serve to do a sports sport or for <unk> or even one can be married there.
This means that three architects can dream in the East Side of New York, and raising half a million dollars of the community together around that cause, no one customer alone.
It means that no building is too small for innovation, like this little <unk> <unk> so <unk> and <unk> like the animals that are going to observe.
Because no matter if it's a cow or a robot who builds our buildings.
It doesn't matter how we built, what matters is what we've built.
architects already know how to make more intelligent, more intelligent, more <unk>
We've been waiting for all of you to want them to you.
Finally, we're not on the opposite sides.
Find an architect, <unk> and <unk> together to make better buildings, better cities, for a better world, because there's a lot of play.
The buildings not just reflect our society, but they give up to the most <unk> places, the <unk> the households where we formed our children, and the step back to the bathroom.
Thank you very much.
This is my <unk> <unk>
It just took a year and started walking.
And it makes it great, typical of the children of a year, <unk> as if your body was moving too fast for his legs.
It's totally <unk>
And one of the things that I like to do for the moment is to look in the mirror.
She really loves his picture.
They <unk> and <unk> and it gives themselves those big <unk> and <unk>
It's beautiful.
Apparently, all of his friends do this and my mom tells me that I used to do it, and he made me think, "When do I just do that?
How did we suddenly be taste with our <unk>
Because, apparently, we don't like it.
Every month, 10 thousand people are looking at the Google: "I am <unk>
This is <unk> it's 13 years old, and it lives in <unk>
And as a teenager, she wants to be dear and fit in.
It's Sunday at night.
It's preparing for the next week at school.
It's a bit of fear -- it's a little bit confused because even though his mom tells all the time it's beautiful, every day in school, someone tells you it's ugly.
As his mom tells me and what his friends, or fellow from the school said, you don't know who believe.
So a video of her, he puts it on YouTube, and begs others who please leave a <unk> "I'm nice or <unk>
Well, until now, <unk> has received more than 13 comments.
Some of these are so <unk> that it doesn't even deserve to think about them.
We talk about a healthy and normal teenager, who gets these answers in one of the stages of their life more emotionally.
Thousands of people are publishing videos like this, mostly teenage girls trying to communicate this way.
But what is it going to do this?
Well, the teenagers today are almost never alone.
They're under pressure of being online and available all the time, talking, <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> -- this never ends.
We've never been so connected, we have never been so connected, in a continuous way.
As a mother said to me, "It's like a party in his room all the <unk>
There's simply no privacy.
And the social pressures they go from hand with that are <unk>
This environment, of being always connected -- it's <unk> our children to <unk> based on the number of likes that they have and the kinds of comments that they get.
There's no division between a live life and real life.
It's really hard to know the differences between what is real or what it isn't.
And also, it's very hard to know the difference between what is authentic and what you have to be shared digitally.
What's the most important thing in the life of someone in front of what is normal in a three-dimensional context.
And where are you looking for <unk>
Well, you can see the kind of images that are <unk> from the <unk>
<unk> <unk> zero follow our <unk>
<unk> technique is now routine.
And trends like, <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk>
For those of you that <unk> <unk> means <unk>
These trends are associated with women in the popular culture.
It's not hard to see what young people are.
But the guys are not immune to this.
As the <unk> stars, the sport, and the singers <unk>
But what is the problem with all this?
Well, we certainly want our children to grow healthy and be individuals.
But in a culture obsessed for the picture, we're teaching our children to spend more time and effort to look at their appearance, at the price of all the other aspects of their identity.
Things like their relationships, development of their physical capabilities and their studies and other aspects begin to suffer.
Six of every 10 girls prefer not to do something because they think they don't look good enough.
These are not <unk> activities.
They are fundamental activities for their growth as humans and taxpayers and the labor of labor development.
31 percent, almost one of three teenagers are not interested in the classroom, they are going to participate in the classroom, because they don't want to call your attention to their physical shape.
One of the five are not coming to class at all, when you don't feel comfortable on it.
And in the season, if you don't think you're good enough, specifically if you don't think you're thin, enough, <unk> a lower note to the average of your fellow who don't care about how it looks like.
And this phenomenon has been widespread in Finland, United States and China.
And it gives you irrespective of what these young ones.
So to make it quite clear, we're talking about how you look at it, not how you really are.
The lower self-worth on your body is <unk> the academic performance.
And it's also <unk> health.
The teenagers with little self-esteem are less than physical activity, they eat fewer fruit and vegetables, they participate in more diets not healthy that they can take them to a food disorder.
They have low self-esteem.
They are more easily <unk> by the people around them and they're at greater risk of depression.
And we think that's all of this for what they make more <unk> decisions.
The search for the perfect body is pushing the health care system, and our government costs billions of dollars every year.
And we're not <unk>
Women who believe that they're overweight again, regardless of whether or don't have higher rates of <unk>
17 percent of women are not present to an interview interview, in a day where they don't feel secure in the way you see.
Think for a moment in what this is doing to our economy.
If we could overcome this, what would that be?
We have this potential for each of us.
But how do we do that?
Well, speaking, for itself, don't take you very far.
It's not enough.
If you really want to change things, you have to do something.
And we've learned that there are three key ways. The first is that we have to nurture confidence in their own body.
We have to help our teenagers to develop strategies to overcome the pressure of the perfect images and build their self-esteem.
The good news is that there are lots of software programs to do it.
The bad news is that most of these don't work.
I was very surprised when I learned that a lot of <unk> programs without realizing -- the situation.
So we have to make sure that the program that our children are not only going to have a positive impact, but also a durable impact.
And research studies show that the best programs are focused on six key areas. The first is the influence of family and friends and relationships.
These six aspects are key points for any willing to provide an education in their bodies that work.
A education is fundamental, but dealing with this problem requires each of us to take the reins on the issue and be a better model to follow women and girls in our own lives.
So the current status of how women are <unk> and I talk about our circles.
It's not good to tell our politicians in <unk> or the size of their <unk> or <unk> that determination or success of an Olympic athlete depends on the fact that it's not quite a lot of beauty.
We need to start to judge people by what they are, not because you see them.
We all can start by taking responsibility for the kind of images and comments that we published in our social networks.
We can engage people based on their effort on their effort and their actions and not in their appearance.
And let me ask you: When was the last time I was going to take a <unk>
In short, we have to work together as communities, like governments and companies, to change our culture, so that our children will grow every single person, valuing the individuality, the diversity, the <unk>
We have to put the people who are really making the difference in a <unk>
It will make a difference in the real world, let's make them the ones that come out on the big screen, because we just create a different world.
A world where our children are free to become the best version of themselves, where the way they believe that they are never going to be the <unk> of being who they are, or to reach out what they want in their lives.
Think about what this can mean for someone in their lives.
Who do you have in mind?
<unk>
<unk>
<unk>
She <unk> A <unk>
It could just be the woman who is going to be two car seats -- what would it mean for her if he was liberated from that <unk> voice in his interior, which was <unk> because he doesn't have a long legs more <unk>
What would it mean for her if we were going to take this out, and we would try to take the potential of that way?
Right now, the obsession of our culture with the images are <unk>
But let's take our children the truth.
I know that the way you see is just a part of your identity, and that the truth is that we love them for those who are and why they do, and because of how they do feel.
They went to self-esteem in the <unk> of our schools.
Let's change every one of us, the way we talk and we compare to other people.
And <unk> together as a community, from small groups to governments, for the small <unk> of a year of today, to become insurance agents of itself tomorrow.
Let's do it.
On the top of November 1990, a gentleman named <unk> <unk> went to a hotel in Manhattan and killed the rabbi, <unk> <unk> the leader of the League of Defense <unk>
At the end, I was initially innocent -- but being imprisoned by other people in the company in the company of others, they started planning attacks at about 12 New York, including <unk> <unk> and the United Nations.
Fortunately, those plans was <unk> by an informant of the FBI.
Sadly, the bomb bomb in the World Trade Center was not able to avoid.
Later on, it would be convicted of their involvement in that <unk>
<unk> <unk> is my father.
I was born in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, in 1983, being an engineer who has a <unk> a <unk> mother teacher.
Only when I was seven years old, our family started to change.
My father taught me a form of Islam, which is very few, including most Muslims get to meet.
For experience I saw that when people take time to interact with, it doesn't take long to wish the same things in life.
However, in every religion, in every human group, there is always a little fraction of people who are <unk> so <unk> to their convictions that think that we have to use all the possible media for everybody living like them.
A few months before arrest he sat with me and explained that in the last week of week, he and some friends, had been going to check on Long Island to practice.
He told me that I would go with him the next day.
We got to the <unk> <unk> which, without knowing our group, I was <unk> by the FBI.
When I got <unk> my father helped me hold the <unk> on the shoulder and explained how to point at about 30 feet.
That day, with the last bullet who shot gave it to the little orange light on the goal, and to come up with all of all, especially of me, the whole target on fire.
My uncle went back to the rest and in Arabic, he said <unk> <unk>
From such a father, such a son.
In all, the comment gave them a lot of laughter. But only a few years later, I understood what they seemed so funny.
They saw me, the same level of destruction that my father could <unk>
Those later people would be committed to put a go put with 700 pounds of explosives in the underground parking lot in the World Trade Center Center -- causing an explosion that killed six people and hurt other 1,000.
I admired those men.
I called it <unk> which means uncle.
When I turned 19, I had moved back 20 times. That will be a lot of <unk>
Every time I started feeling comfortable close to someone who was now of packing and go to another city.
As long as I was always my new side of the class often was <unk>
<unk> secret my identity to avoid being the white one, but it will be the new of the class, quiet and <unk> was enough <unk>
So most of the time I went on home reading books, watching TV or playing video games.
So for these reasons not developed social skills, to say that, to grow under <unk> I was not prepared for the world.
I will be <unk> <unk> by judge people, based on indicators like their race or their religion.
So how could I open the eyes?
One of the first experiences that they put up to test my way to think, was during the president of 2000.
In a <unk> program where I was involved in the National Convention, in Philadelphia.
My group was <unk> in the subject of juvenile violence, as I had been <unk> almost my whole life, was something that I felt a lot of passion.
The members of this group came from different <unk>
One day, toward the end of the <unk> I discovered that one of the guys who we had done anger was Jew
I took a number of days out of the light on this detail and I realized that there was no <unk> among the two.
I had never had a Jewish friend and frankly I was very proud to have been able to overcome the barrier that all life had been made to believe that it was <unk>
Another crucial moment emerged when I got a summer job in Bush, and a <unk> park.
I found people from all kinds of beliefs and cultures. That experience was critical in the development of my character.
All life had taught me that <unk> was a sin and for extension, all gay men were bad <unk>
I happened to have the opportunity to work with gay actors there, in a show, and I could see that several of them were the most nice and less critics who had seen in life.
Having been a kid, I developed a sense of empathy towards the suffering of others, but it wasn't easy for me to treat people exactly the way that I would have wanted to be treated.
And for that feeling that I could contrast the stereotypes that had taught me about the experience of interaction in real life.
I don't know how that of being <unk> but I know what is <unk> by something beyond my control.
Then he came the <unk> <unk>
Every night, Jon Stewart made me <unk> honest about my <unk> and helped me see that race of people, religion or sexual orientation, has nothing to do with character.
In a lot of shapes he became my <unk> figure where I was desperately <unk>
Occasionally the inspiration can come from the unexpected. And a Jewish comedian would have had a better influence in my life that my own father, <unk> wasn't in vain.
One day I had a conversation with my mother about how I was changing my way to think, and she told me something I keep in my heart for always, while he's alive.
She looked at me with my eyes tired of someone who has suffered enough <unk> and he said, "I'm tired of <unk>
At that moment I realized how much negative energy you need to keep all that hate hate to keep all that hatred in.
My real name is not <unk> <unk>
It changed when my family decided to break the relationship with my father and start a new life.
So why did I go out and put myself in a possible risk?
Well, it's easy.
I've done it because I'm hoping that somebody, one day, whom you're trying to take to violence, I can hear my story and understand that there is a better bit better than even though I went to this violent ideology and <unk> I didn't get to make me <unk>
On the other hand, I decided to use my experience to fight terrorism and against prejudice.
I do it by the victims of terrorism and their loved loved pain and losses that terrorism has produced them in their lives.
For the victims of the terrorism talking, against those acts of sense, like rejection acts of my father.
With this <unk> I put myself here as a proof that violence is not inherent for any religion or race, that children don't have to follow the trails of their parents.
I'm not my father.
Thank you.  Thank you all.  Thank you very much.
At this point, there's a movie that is projected in your mind.
It's an incredible film.
It's in 3D, and it has <unk> sound of what you hear and see right now, but that's just the start.
Your movie has sound, taste and texture.
It feels your body, your pain, your pleasure.
It has <unk> anger and happiness.
It has memories, as a moment of childhood that I project in front of your eyes.
And it has constantly a voice superimposed in your conscious thinking.
The heart of the movie is you who experience everything directly.
This movie is your <unk> the subject of the mind of the mind and the world.
Consciousness is one of the fundamental truths of the human being.
Each of us is conscious.
We all have a single internal movie -- you, you and you.
There's nothing to be more directly.
At least, I know that I have an awareness for you.
I don't know that you're aware of you.
Consciousness is also the reason for living.
If we weren't aware of it, nothing in our lives would make sense or value.
But at the same time is the most mysterious phenomenon.
Why are we <unk>
Why do we have these films <unk>
Why are we not just the robots that we have to do to produce outcomes without experiencing the movie <unk>
At this point, nobody knows the answers to those questions.
I suggest to integrate the awareness to science, you need some radical ideas.
Some people say it's impossible a science of consciousness.
Science for nature, is objective it.
<unk> for nature, is <unk>
So there can be no science of consciousness.
Because for almost all the 20th century, that vision.
psychology was studying civic behavior, neuroscience was studying the brain, but no one mentioned consciousness.
Even 30 years ago, when TED began, there was very few scientists about consciousness.
<unk> 20 years ago, all started to change.
<unk> as Francis and physicists like Roger Bannister said, <unk> is the moment for science <unk> <unk>
And since then, there was a real bang, a flowering of the scientific work about consciousness.
And this work was fantastic. It was great.
But it also has fundamental limits to the moment.
The center of the science of consciousness in recent years was the pursuit of <unk> correlations between some areas of the brain, and some states of consciousness.
We saw some of this guy at the great work I presented Nancy <unk> a few minutes ago.
We now understand much better, for example, the areas of the brain that are related to the conscious experience of looking at faces or feeling pain or feeling happy.
But this is still a science of <unk>
It's not a science.
We know that these areas of the brain are related to certain kinds of conscious experience, but we don't know why.
I'd like to explain that this kind of work of neuroscience answer some questions that we want to explain to consciousness. The questions about what certain areas of the brain, and what are they <unk>
But in a sense, those are the easy problems.
No offense to <unk>
In reality, there is no easy problems with consciousness.
Well, not tackles the real mystery of this <unk> why all of the physical process in the brain has to be accompanied by consciousness?
Why is there a <unk> movie <unk>
At this point, we can't understand it.
And you can say, let's give it a few years to neuroscience.
It's going to turn into another emerging phenomenon, like <unk> like the <unk> like life, and we're going to find a explanation.
The topics are all of the things of emerging behaviors, how do we operate the <unk> how they work, how they are <unk> and <unk> the living organisms and they're all questions about how target works.
That could be applied to the human brain to explain some behaviors and function of the human brain as a <unk> phenomenon, how we talked to how we talk to <unk> all of these are questions about behavior.
But when it comes to consciousness, questions about behavior are between the easy problems.
But the hard problem is the question of why all of the behavior is accompanied by an out-of-body experience.
And here it is, the standard paradigm of <unk> the standard paradigm of neuroscience, actually still doesn't have a lot to say.
I am a <unk> scientist of heart.
I want a scientific theory of <unk> which works. For a long time, I hit my head against the wall looking for a theory of consciousness in pure terms that would work.
But at the end I came to the conclusion that that was not working for reasons.
I think we're going to get into this point.
We have a chain of wonderful explanation, so great. We get used to this, the physics explains chemistry, chemistry explains biology, biology explains a part of psychology.
But consciousness doesn't seem to fit in this scheme.
On the one hand, it's a fact that we're aware of it.
On the other, we don't know how to put that idea to our scientific vision in the world.
I think the consciousness, right now, is a kind of <unk> something we need to integrate our vision of the world, but we don't know even how.
With an anomaly like this, you can need radical ideas, I think we need ideas that at the beginning <unk> crazy before we can deal with the consciousness in a scientific way.
There are some possibilities for those crazy ideas.
My friend Dan Dennett, which is here today, has one.
His crazy idea is that there is no such problem of consciousness.
The whole idea of the subjective world includes a kind of illusion or confusion.
In fact, what you have to do, is to explain the functions -- the brain behaviors -- and so you study everything that needs to explanation.
Well, more power for it.
That's the kind of radical idea that we need to explore if we want to have a theory of <unk> consciousness based on the brain.
At the same time, for a lot of others, that vision is pretty close to simply deny that the observation of consciousness is <unk>
But I'm going in a different direction.
In the time we left, I want to explore two crazy ideas that I think can be <unk>
The first crazy idea is that consciousness is fundamental.
physicists are sometimes taking some aspects of the universe as a <unk> <unk> space, time and mass.
We bring fundamental laws that are <unk> like the laws of gravity or quantum mechanics.
These laws and fundamental properties don't explain in terms of nothing more basic.
Rather, they look at principles, and there is actually building the world.
Sometimes, the list of the fundamental <unk>
In the 19th century, it found out that you can't explain the electromagnetic phenomena in terms of fundamental concepts in space, and long, mass, laws of Newton.
I think that's the situation that we have with consciousness.
If you can't explain consciousness in terms of fundamental ideas -- space, time mass, time, so because of logic, you have to <unk> the list.
The most natural thing would be <unk> consciousness as a fundamental thing, a fundamental brick of nature.
This doesn't mean that suddenly not the object of science.
It opens the way to <unk> scientifically.
So what we need is to study the fundamental laws that govern consciousness, the laws that connect consciousness with other key concepts -- space, the space, the mass, physical processes.
physicists sometimes say we want very simple laws as simple as we can do it in a <unk>
The situation of consciousness is something like that.
We want to find fundamental laws so simple we can put them into a t-shirt.
We still don't know what laws are, but that's what we're looking for.
The second crazy idea is that consciousness can be universal.
Every system can have a degree of consciousness.
This view is sometimes called <unk> <unk> for everyone, <unk> for mind, every system is conscious -- not only humans, the dogs, the mice, even the microbes in Rob <unk> the elementary particles.
Even a <unk> has some degree of consciousness.
The idea is not that photons are smart or <unk>
It's not that one <unk> can be full of distress when I think boxes, it will always travel at the speed of light.
I can never slow down and smell the <unk>
No, that's not.
But thinking is that maybe photons can have some kind of crude feeling -- some early precursor to consciousness.
This may sound a little crazy for you.
How would someone think that <unk>
In part of this comes from the first crazy idea, that consciousness is a fundamental thing.
If it's fundamental like space, time and mass, it's natural assume that it can also be universal, just like others.
It's also worth noticing that even though the idea is <unk> it's so much less for the people of different cultures, where the human mind seems more a continuum with nature.
A deeper reason comes from the idea that perhaps the simplest and powerful form of finding fundamental laws that <unk> thinking with the physical process, is <unk> awareness with information.
There is always information processing, there's awareness.
<unk> of complex <unk> like in a human being, awareness.
<unk> of simple simple, awareness.
A very exciting thing is that in the recent years a neuroscientist, a neuroscientist, <unk> <unk> took this kind of theory, and I developed <unk> with mathematical methods.
It has a mathematical measure of information integration, which is called <unk> which measures the degree of integrated information in a system.
And it's supposed to be able to do with consciousness.
So in a human brain, there's an incredible degree of information integration, a degree of <unk> a lot of consciousness.
In a mouse there's a degree of information integration of information, equal to a pretty important awareness.
But when you get to the worms, microbes, the particles -- the degree of <unk> <unk>
The level of information integration is lower, but it's not zero either.
In <unk> theory, there is still a level of <unk>
It made a fundamental law of <unk> high grade <unk> high of consciousness.
Also, another reason is that <unk> can help us integrate the awareness into the physical world.
physicists and philosophers have often observed that physics is curiously abstract.
It describes the structure of reality using a lot of equations, but we don't talk about the reality underlying the reality underlying us.
As Stephen Hawking, "Where is the fire <unk>
From vision, the equations of physics can leave as they are, but you can use to describe the flow of consciousness.
That's what physicists do basically describe the flow of consciousness.
According to this vision, consciousness is that he puts fire on the equations.
In that view, consciousness doesn't find out the physical world as a kind of <unk>
It's right there in the center.
This vision is, I think, the <unk> vision has the potential to deal with our relationship with nature, and it can have very serious social and ethical and ethical and ethical and ethical and ethical and ethical and ethical and ethical and ethical and ethical and ethical and ethical and ethical and ethical and ethical and ethical and ethical and ethical and ethical consequences.
Some of them can be <unk>
I used to think that I didn't have to eat anything that had a consciousness, then I had to be a <unk>
If you're a <unk> and you accept that vision, you'll have a lot of hungry.
I think this tends to transform your <unk> while what matters in terms of ethical and moral <unk> is not so much of consciousness, but its importance and complexity.
It's also natural to ask by consciousness in other systems like computers.
What about the artificial intelligence system of Samantha <unk>
It's <unk>
According to the vision of <unk> information, she has an integrated information processing so that the answer is yes, if it's conscious.
If this is right -- they are doing pretty serious ethical problems about the developmental ethic of intelligent computers and the ethics ethic.
Finally, you can ask by the awareness of the collective <unk> the planet.
Canada has their own consciousness?
Or at a local level, an integrated group -- like the audience in a TED Talk -- at this point, we have a great collective consciousness -- a internal movie for this whole group of TED, different from the inner films of each of the <unk>
I don't know the answer to that question, but I think at least is a question that must take seriously.
So this <unk> <unk> is a radical vision, and I don't know if it's right.
I'm actually more sure of the first crazy idea -- that consciousness is a fundamental thing, which is a fundamental thing, which is universal.
Vision raises a lot of questions, so many challenges, like, how do those bits of thinking contribute to the kind of complex consciousness that we know and love.
If we can answer those questions, then I think we go on the right path to a theory of serious.
If not, well, probably this is the most difficult problem for science and philosophy.
We can't wait to solve it at night in the morning.
But I think we're finally going to get to find it.
Understanding consciousness is the real key, I think, to understand the universe and to understand ourselves.
Maybe we just need the crazy idea.
Thank you.
I grew up in a small rural village in Victoria.
He had a very normal, a low profile, a beneath education.
I went to school, I went to my friends with my friends, <unk> me with my younger sisters.
Everything was very normal.
And when I was 15 years old, a member of my community came up to my parents, because I wanted to <unk> for a community for the community.
And my parents said, "Well, that's very nice, but there's a single problem.
She actually didn't get anything."
I went to school, I had good grades. after school, I had a low profile, and I was spending a lot of time looking at the <unk> the <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk>
Yeah, I know. What contradiction.
But they were right.
I didn't do anything extraordinary at all.
Nothing that can be considered as a achievement if we took the disability out of the equation.
Years later, being in the second part of teaching me at a high school of <unk> only after about 20 minutes in the class of 11 studies -- a guy raised the hand and said, "Hey, when you give your <unk>
I said, "What do you do?"
Well, I had been talking about the law of <unk> for a good 20 minutes.
And he said, "You know, your discourse <unk>
When people in the wheels, they talk about <unk> things in college.
"For the general room in <unk>
And it was when I realized, this kid had had with disabled people such as <unk> objects.
And we don't know, it's not the fault of the boy, I mean, that's true for many of us.
For us, young people are not our teachers or our doctors or our <unk>
We're not real people.
And in fact, I'm on this <unk> stage, which I do in this wheelchair, and you're probably waiting for you. Right?  Yes.
Well, ladies and gentlemen, I'm afraid <unk> <unk>
I'm not here to <unk>
I'm here to tell you that they have lied to disability.
Yeah, we have sold the lie that disability is <unk> A capital <unk>
It's kind of bad and living with a disability makes you remarkable.
It's not a bad thing, and it doesn't make you write to you.
And in the last few years, we've been able to spread even more is through social media.
You may have seen images like this: "The Only disability in life is a bad <unk>
Or this <unk> "Your excuse is <unk>
Or this <unk> "Before <unk> <unk>
These are just a couple of examples, but there's a lot of them.
You may have seen one of the girl without hands drawing with a pencil held by the mouth.
You may have seen a kid running out of a carbon optic legs.
And there's a lot of these images, which are what we call <unk> inspiration.
And I use the term porn <unk> because we went to a group of people for the benefit of another group of people.
So in this case, <unk> the disabled people in the benefit of people without disabilities.
The purpose of these images is <unk> <unk> so we can see them and say, "Well, because of my life, it might be worse.
I could be that person."
But if you're that person?
I've lost the account of the number of times that have been tackled with strange to express you believe that I am brave or a source of inspiration, and this will happen before my work had a public profile.
It was as if I took up on the morning and remember my own name.  And this is <unk>
These images, those images are <unk> to the people who have disabled people in the benefit of people without disabilities.
They're there for you to see and think that things are not so bad for you, or to put your concerns in perspective.
And life as a disabled person is actually something difficult.
So let's make some things.
But the things that we overcome are not the things that you can think about.
They are not relative to our bodies.
I use the term <unk> <unk> deliberately because I gave it to the social media social model that tells us that we are more disabled because of society where we are living because of our bodies or diagnostics.
So I've lived in this body for a long time.
I'm really excited about it.
It makes the things that I need to do, and I've learned how to get the best of your capacity as well as you do, and that's what happens with the kids of those pictures too.
They're not doing anything out of the common.
They're simply using their bodies by taking the best of their capability.
So it's really just <unk> in the way we do that, by sharing those <unk>
When people say, "You're a source of <unk> it says it as a compliment.
And I know why it happens.
It's because of the lie, because you have sold this lie that disability makes us quite exceptional enough.
And honestly, I don't do it.
And I know what you're thinking.
I'm here <unk> the inspiration, and you think, "My God, <unk> you're not sometimes inspired by anything?"
And I know I am.
<unk> of other people at every time.
Yet, I don't know that I'm more fortunate than them.
<unk> which is a great idea to use <unk> <unk> to collect the things that they fall over to me.  <unk> the ingenious trick of how to charge battery battery in the battery battery.
Great.
We learn from the force and resistance of others, not against our bodies and our <unk> but against a world that <unk> and <unk> us.
I really believe that that lie that they have sold us about disability is the biggest <unk>
It makes us hard life.
And that quote: "The only disability in life is a bad <unk> the reason that that's lies is because it's not true, because of the social model.
A lot of smiles, to a stretch of stairs has not ever done to become a <unk>
Never.   <unk> in front of a TV screen will not make the <unk> for the <unk>
Also a lot of people in the midst of a bookstore and <unk> a positive attitude to turn all those books into the <unk>
It's just not going to happen.
I want to really live in a world where disability is not exception, but the norm.
I want to live where a 10-year-old girl, sitting in his dorm room looking at the <unk> <unk> don't consider it anything to be in a chair.
I want to live in a world where we don't have as low expectations of the people who have disability to be <unk> by getting out of bed and remember our names in the morning.
I want to live in a world where the genuine achievement of the people, and I want to live in a world where a child of 11 degree in a high school in Melbourne is not a little surprised that his new teacher is a <unk>
disability doesn't make us <unk> but question what you think to know about what you do.
Thank you.
What do you have to see the augmented reality and the professional football with <unk>
And what is the average speed of a <unk> <unk>
Unfortunately today I just respond to one of those questions, so please don't <unk>
When people think actually <unk> think about <unk> <unk> and in Tom <unk> <unk> hands in the air, but virtual reality is not science fiction.
<unk> reality is something that will happen in our days and will happen because we have the tools for it, and people need to find out, because reality is augmented changing our lives as much as the Internet and mobile phones.
So, how do we get to reality <unk>
The first step, is what I'm wearing -- the Google <unk>
I'm sure that many people are familiar with them.
What you might not know is that Google <unk> are a device that lets them see what I see.
They will allow them to experience what is a professional <unk> in the country.
Right now, the only way to be in the field is that I try to <unk>
I have to use words.
I have to create a framework that you would have to do with your imagination.
We can use the Google Glass, under a helmet and know what is running by the field of play the blood hitting the ears.
We can know that a man of 110 pounds -- we can find out trying to engage them with everything that will be.
I've been there and I assure you that it's not nice.
I would take some videos to show you what the Google would be used under the shell, and give them an idea of that.
Unfortunately, these are not images of <unk> practices because the idea of the emerging technology is a submarine rising to the surface. But we do what we can.
So let's look at a video.
Chris <unk> Go.
It's horrible to be <unk>
A moment. <unk> a little bit.
<unk>
Go!
Chris <unk> As you can see, it's a <unk> of what is going to be <unk> in the field of <unk>
You may have realized that lack of people, the rest of the team.
We have a video of them, from the University of Washington.
<unk> <unk> mice.
Blue <unk> <unk> <unk> Come on!
Chris <unk> This is a little bit more to the feeling of being in the field, but it has nothing to do with being in <unk>
The fans want that experience.
The fans want to be in the field, it's going to be their favorite players -- and they have asked me on YouTube and in <unk> you can see from the angle of a field of <unk>
or a <unk>
We want to experiment with that."
Once we have that experience with <unk> and Google Glass, how do we go from <unk> how we take it to the next <unk>
We took it to that level using something called <unk> <unk> which is probably a lot of you know.
The Rift <unk> has been described as the most realistic virtual reality apparatus ever created, and it's not <unk> cheap.
And I'm going to show you why by this video.
Man: Oh.
No, no, no, I don't want to follow it."
Oh my God! Ah!
<unk> That's the experience of a man on a Russian mountain, <unk> for his life.
What will be the experience of a fan when you take a video of Adrian <unk> across the line, <unk> from a <unk> with the arm before you run and make a <unk> What's the experience of a fan of a fan of a fan of a fan of a fan of a fan of a fan of a fan of a fan.
When I could be <unk> running by the <unk> launching the ball at the bottom of the network?  So you get a <unk> in <unk>
What is your experience when you get a mountain to over 100 miles an hour as a <unk> <unk>
Maybe it's <unk> the <unk> for adults.
But this is not really true.
It's just virtual reality, <unk>
How do we get <unk> <unk>
<unk> the reality of augmented when the Italians <unk> and the owners see the information that people want to see and say, "How do we use this to improve our <unk>
How do we use it to win <unk>
Because they always use the technology to win.
They like to win. They give them money.
So here's a brief refresher on the technology in <unk>
In <unk> the Baltimore <unk> put a <unk> to his field of field for playing faster.
They won the Super Bowl that year.
Other teams decided to be <unk>
More people saw the game because it was more exciting, faster.
In 1994, the <unk> put out the <unk> in the <unk> of <unk> and then in the <unk>
They had more <unk> because it was faster, more fun.
In <unk> imagine that you are a player coming back to your group and see their next small play you see in front of you, in a plastic bombsight that you have to.
or by keeping the strategy.
They just go out to the field and get it out.
And the coaches want it because if you don't follow their instructions, they lose parties, and they hate losing games.
If you lose playing parties as a coach.
And they don't want that.
But augmented reality is not just a <unk> strategies.
<unk> reality is also a way to collect information and use it in real time to improve the game.
How do you do?
Well, a very simple option would be a camera in every corner of the stadium having a view from the top of the people who are down.
You also get information from the sensors from the <unk> and the <unk> something that's already working on.
And all that information gets you to your players.
The good equipment will be <unk>
The bad ones have <unk>
This is <unk> the good equipment.
So your computer team will be as important as your <unk> and data analysis will stop being <unk>
And who would be <unk> Who would have <unk>
How would it be in the country?
Imagine that it's the <unk>
They took the ball and <unk>
I went to an open receiver -- a <unk> on the left side of your bombsight -- you know, a defense behind you is going to <unk> Normally but the <unk> system will be <unk>
<unk> to the area of protection.
Another <unk> <unk> that there's an open receptor.
<unk> <unk> but <unk>
And the ball loses the trajectory.
You don't know where the receptor is the receptor on its bombsight -- an area of grass that lights up and can modify the race.
They <unk> it takes the <unk> running and <unk>
The audience is <unk> and the fans have followed the play from every angle.
This is something that creates massive emotion in the party.
I'm going to make lots of people see it, because people want to live that experience.
The fans want to be in the field, the fans want to be in the field.
They want to be your favorite player.
<unk> reality will be part of the sports because it's too profitable to not be.
But what I ask you is, we want this to be the only use of reality <unk>
We're going to use it just like <unk> and <unk> like our <unk> entertainment.
Because I think we can use it for more.
I think we can use augmented reality to foster empathy between human beings, to show someone how literally it is, literally, being in the other person.
We know what this technology is worth for <unk>
It produces billions of income a year.
But how much is this technology worth a professor in the classroom trying to show a <unk> how bad their actions are from the perspective of <unk>
How much is this technology worth a gay thing in Uganda or Russia, trying to show the world how they live <unk>
How much is it worth a <unk> or an <unk> Neil <unk> trying to inspire a generation of kids to think about the space and the science instead of <unk> and <unk> notes and <unk>
Ladies and gentlemen, reality reality is coming.
The questions we do, the decisions we take and the challenges we face -- <unk> as usual, of us.
Thank you.
I recently told me after 23 years of service in the <unk> <unk> of California.
Most of those 23 years of the country would be <unk> the southern end of the county of <unk> which includes the Golden Gate Bridge.
The bridge is a <unk> structure known for its beautiful view of San Francisco, the Pacific Ocean.
Unfortunately, it's also a magnet for suicide, being one of the largest places in the world.
The Golden Gate Bridge was open in <unk>
Joseph <unk> engineer, boss <unk> to build the bridge, said that, "The bridge is essentially <unk>
<unk> from the bridge is not practical and <unk>
But from his openness, more than 1,600 people have jumped to their death from that bridge.
Some of them believe that traveling between the two towers will take them to another dimension, this bridge has been <unk> as such, so that every one of it frees you out of all your concerns and pain, and the waters that go under <unk> your soul.
But let me tell you that when the bridge is used to make suicide.
After one every free of four to five seconds, the body hits the water about 120 miles an hour.
The impact breaks the bone, some of which will make life organs.
Most of the world's impact.
The people who don't normally get on the water <unk> and then they <unk>
I don't think that that <unk> this method of suicide will realize <unk> death to the <unk>
This is the wire.
Except about the two towers, there's 32 inches of parallel steel on the bridge.
This is where most people are for before they take their life.
I can tell you for experience that once the person is on that edge, and at the dark time, it's very hard to bring it back.
I took this picture last year while this young woman talked to a official looking at his life.
I want to tell you with joy that we had success that day bring it back on the <unk>
When I started working on the bridge, we didn't have formal training.
<unk> to channel the way through these calls.
This was not just a bad service for those who <unk> suicide, but the officials as well.
We have a long way since then.
Today, veterans and psychologists train the new official people.
This is Jason <unk>
I met this July July 22 year of getting a call from a possible suicide bomber sitting on the <unk> near the center.
<unk> and when I got there, I looked at Jason talking to an officer.
Jason was only 32 years old and he had flown up here from New Jersey.
In fact, I had flown up here two times before New Jersey to try and commit suicide from this bridge.
After about an hour talking to <unk> we asked us if we knew the story of the box of <unk>
<unk> the mythology called <unk> <unk> I created <unk> and sent it to the Earth with a box, and said, <unk> never open that <unk>
Well, one day, the curiosity could more than <unk> and she opened the box.
Of course, they came out <unk> <unk> and all kinds of <unk> against the man.
The only good thing in the box was hope.
So Jason said, "What if you open the box and there's no <unk>
They stopped a few <unk> leaned on the right, and it left.
This kind kind kind of smart and intelligent boy in New Jersey had just got the life.
I talked to the parents of Jason that night, and I guess when I was talking to them, it didn't seem to be ringing very well, because the next day, the family members called me to see how I am.
The parents of Jason had had order.
<unk> damage is going to be a lot of people.
I tell you these questions: What would you do if a member of your family or a friend or somebody loved it.
So what do you do?
Ask me what by that?
In my experience, not just to talk to me, but you have to listen to it.
Listening to understand.
Not <unk> <unk> or tell the person you know how you feel, because they probably didn't do it."
Just being there, you can be the tipping point that need.
If you think that somebody is <unk> don't be afraid of <unk> and ask the question.
One way to ask the question is, <unk> in similar circumstances have thought about finishing their life, you've got these <unk>
They went to the front person in front of their life, they can save life and be the turning point for them.
Other signs to <unk> despair, believe that things are terrible and they're never going to be <unk> to believe that there's nothing that you can do to the <unk> social isolation, and a lost interest in interest in life.
I came up with this talk just a couple of days, and I got an email from a lady and I'd like to read your letter.
She lost his son January of January of this year, and he wrote this email just a couple of days, and he's with his permission and blessing that I read it.
"Hello, <unk> I imagine you're at the TED conference.
It must be a whole experience to be there.
I'm thinking that I should go on the bridge this weekend.
I just wanted to leave you a note.
I hope you can tell a lot of people and go home talking about it to your friends who tell your friends, etc.
I'm still quite <unk> but I'm noticing more moments of realization that Mike will not go home.
Mike was driving to San Francisco to San Francisco to see the game of the 49 of the <unk> of January.
It never came there.
I knocked on the police of <unk> and the <unk> as disappeared that night.
The next morning, two officials came to my house and told me that the car car was down on the bridge.
A witness I had seen it from the bridge to the <unk> on the evening of the day before.
Thank you very much for fighting those who can be temporarily too weak to fight themselves.
Who hasn't been <unk> without having a real mental illness.
It shouldn't be so easy to end with it.
My sentences are with you for your struggle.
The <unk> the Golden Gate Bridge is supposed to be a passage through our beautiful, <unk>
Good luck this week, <unk>
I can't imagine the courage that she needed to go to the bridge and walk the way his son took that day, and also the courage to go on.
I'd like to introduce you to a man where I refer to hope and value.
On March 11, of 2005, I replied a radio phone for a possible subject of a possible suicide bomber on the street.
I went on my <unk> on the sidewalk and looked at this man, Kevin <unk> standing on the sidewalk.
When he looked at me, he crossed the <unk> and he stopped in that little tube that goes around the tower.
Over the time and a half later, I heard how Kevin spoke about his depression and despair.
Kevin decided to come back on that lane and give life another opportunity.
When Kevin turned out, it was <unk>
"This is a new beginning, a new life."
But I asked her, "What was it that did that <unk> and gave it to hope and life another <unk>
And you know what he told me.
He said, "I am <unk>
They stopped me talking and simply <unk>
Little after that incident, I got a letter from the mother of Kevin <unk> and I have that letter.
"Dear Mr. <unk> Nothing erase the 11th events and you're one of the reasons why Kevin is still with us.
Honestly, I think Kevin was <unk> for help.
It's been diagnosed with a mental illness, which has been correctly <unk>
I went to Kevin when I was only six months old, absolutely unconscious of all those traits -- <unk> but thanks to God, we now know it.
Kevin is in order, as he says.
We thank God for you.
I really went on debt with you, <unk> <unk>
And at the end, she writes -- <unk> -- when I visited the General in San Francisco at that night, you will be <unk> as the patient.
I know that I did have it <unk>
Currently, Kevin is a <unk> father and an active member of society.
It talks openly about the events of that day and their depression with the hope that their story will inspire others.
<unk> is not just something that I've been found at work.
It's personal.
My grandfather <unk> <unk>
That act, despite the end of his own pain, give me the chance to meet him.
This is what suicide.
For most people who are <unk> or those who consider the suicide, you wouldn't think of hurt another person.
They just want their own <unk> pain.
And so large, this is actually accomplished three things: sleep, drugs or alcohol or death.
In my career, I've responded and I've been involved in hundreds of mental illnesses and calls of suicide around the bridge.
Of those incidents that I've been directly involved in is just lost two, but those two are too much.
One was <unk>
The other one was a man who told him about an hour.
For that time, I took my hand at three times.
In the end, he looked at me, and he said, <unk> I'm sorry, but I have to go."
And <unk>
<unk> absolutely horrible.
I want to tell you, though, that most of the people that we get to contact on that bridge is not <unk>
In addition to those few that have jumped from the bridge and lived and that you can talk about it, that one percent or two percent, most of those people have said that the second thing that they leave the railing realized that they had made a mistake and wanted to live.
I tell people, the bridge doesn't just connect to San Francisco, but also the people.
That connection, or the bridge that we do, is something that every single one and every one of us must be able to be able to be able to do to do.
<unk> can prevent.
There's help. There is hope.
Thank you very much.
The world makes you know you don't say, but in your inside you know what you are, and a question. How do you look at that?
I have to be a unique thing in that sense, but I'm not alone in any way I'm alone.
When I became a model I felt that I had finally done the dream that I had ever had since I had been a child.
My outside eventually <unk> with my inner truth.
For complicated reasons why I'm going to refer to the later when I look at this picture, I look at this picture, I think, you know, <unk> <unk>
But last October, I discovered that, <unk> I'm just beginning.
We all care about our families, our religion, our society, our time in history, even our bodies.
Some people have the value of <unk> to get rid of the <unk> of the skin of the skin or because of the beliefs around us.
They are people who are always challenging the status quo -- what is considered <unk>
In my case, the last nine years, many of my neighbors -- many of my neighbors -- my agent even, my <unk>
I think this riddle is called revelation.
This is mine.
I was recorded as <unk> at birth because of the appearance of my <unk>
I remember my five years in the Philippines, in my house, I was always wearing this t-shirt in his head.
And my mom wondered, "Why do you have that t-shirt <unk>
I said, "Mom, it's my hair. I'm a <unk>
I knew then, how do you start?
gender has always been considered a <unk> but we now know that in fact, it's something more complex and mystery now.
Because of my success, I would never get to share my story, not because I thought that being what I'm a bad thing, but why the world is all about those of us who want to be <unk>
I really appreciate being a woman.
I have a mom, my dad and a family who take me as I am.
Many aren't so fortunate.
There's a long tradition in American culture that celebrates the mystery of gender gender.
There's a Buddhist goddess of compassion.
There's a <unk> goddess of <unk>
And when I was eight years old, I was at a party in the Philippines who celebrated these mysteries.
I was standing in front of the stage and I remember that this beautiful woman appeared in front of me, and I remember that moment as something like me, this is the kind of woman I would like to be.
And when I was 15, when I was still wearing a man, I met this woman named <unk>
It's the director of a <unk> beauty competition.
That night she asked me, "Why haven't been involved in the <unk> competition.
He told me that if she got to her, she was responsible for the mandatory <unk> and <unk> and he won a toilet, he won a <unk> and he got a third <unk> in the <unk>
That moment changed my life.
Suddenly, I was inside the world of beauty.
Not many people can say that their first job was queen of beauty of women, but I can.
I also met the god of <unk> especially when I went to the remote provinces of the Philippines.
But more importantly, all of that, I met my best friends in that community.
In 2001, my mom.
I got <unk>
I told my mother, "Mommy, I'm <unk>
I'm here with friends, I like to travel and be a queen of <unk>
But then, two weeks later, he called me and said, "You know that if you hit the United States -- you can change the name and the identity of <unk>
It was all I needed to hear.
My mom suggested that I was two <unk> to my name.
She also stayed in Thailand to Thailand to age 19.
It's curious that in some of the most rural cities of Thailand do the most sophisticated surgeries and safer.
In that time in the United States, it was necessary to do the surgery before we changed the name and the gender.
So in 2001, I went to San Francisco, and I remember looking at the driver's license, with the name of <unk> and the gender <unk>
It was a great moment.
For some people, their identity document means power or being able to get a <unk> but for me it was the driver's license, to feel <unk>
Suddenly, my fears looked <unk>
I felt I could conquer my dream and move to New York, and it will be model.
Many aren't so fortunate.
I think of this woman of <unk> <unk> <unk>
A young woman in New York who came up with his truth, but he said, <unk> he brought his life.
For many of my community, that's the reality that they live.
Our suicide rates are eight times higher than the rest of the population.
All the 20 of November we make a global <unk> by the <unk> Day.
I'm on this stage, thanks to a long history of people who <unk> and he stood up for injustice.
These are Marsha P. Johnson and Sylvia <unk>
Today, right now, I'm coming out of the closet.
I can't follow my truth alone and just for me.
I want to do the best to help others to live their truth without shame.
I'm here, <unk> so that one day no longer has been more than 20 percent <unk>
My deeper truth led me to accept what I am.
Are you going to do that?
Thank you very much.
Thank you, thank you -- thank you.  <unk> <unk> <unk> a quick question.
<unk> <unk> Sure. First of all, thank you all, thank all of my <unk>
My support network, my parents especially, to my family, which is very strong.
I remember all the times that I've been to young young women who have been <unk> and sometimes when they were called me and told me that their parents could not take it, and I would say, "Mommy, can you call this <unk>
Sometimes it worked. That's not just identity identity, that's what is in the center of what we are, right?
I mean, everybody was assigned to a gender at birth, and what I'm trying to do is to put on the table the subject that sometimes that assignment is not block, and that there should be a conversation that would allow people to say, and this is a conversation that we should have with parents, with colleagues.
<unk> movement is <unk> compared to the gay movement.
There's still a lot of work to do.
There should have understanding.
There should be space for curiosity and asking questions, and I hope you all are my allies.
KS: Thank you. Very kind.
In a lot of <unk> and tribal societies -- the parents usually know about their kids, but I'm one of the few parents who are known for their daughter and I'm proud of it.
<unk> started his campaign for defending his rights in 2007.
Before that, it was my daughter, but now I'm his father.
Ladies and gentlemen, if you take a look at the history of humanity, the history of women is the history of the <unk> of violence and exploitation.
You see, in <unk> societies right from the beginning -- when when I was born a little girl, their birth is not <unk>
It's not welcome for his father, not for his mother.
The neighborhood comes, he gives her <unk> to the mother and no one <unk> the father.
And a mother would be <unk> a lot for having a girl.
When it comes to the first child, the first daughter, who gets sad.
When it gives light to the second daughter, <unk> and, with the hope for a son, when he said, his third daughter, it feels guilty like a criminal.
Not just the <unk> but the daughter, <unk> daughter when it grows, he suffers too.
At the age of five, when I should go to school, you get home and the teaching school for his siblings.
Up until the age of 12 years somehow has a good life.
Can you be <unk>
It can play with your friends in the street, and it can move through the streets as a butterfly.
But when it comes into adolescence, when it is 13 years old, he was assigned to go from his house without a male <unk>
It's confined to the four walls of their house.
It's no longer a free person.
It becomes called his father's honor of his father and his brothers and his family and his family, and if you were going to get the code of that of that -- honor, he could even kill.
And it's interesting that this idea of honor, not only does it affect the life of a <unk> it also affects the life of male member of the family.
So this brother, <unk> the joys of his life and happiness of his sisters for the course of honor death.
And there's a norm more of the <unk> societies called <unk>
It's supposed to be a good girl supposed to be very humble and very <unk>
It's the judgment.
The model of a good girl must be <unk>
It's supposed to be silent and he accepts the decisions of his father and his mother and the decisions of the elderly -- even if he doesn't want to.
If you put it with a man who doesn't like it, or if you put it with an old man, has to be <unk> because he doesn't want to be <unk>
If the <unk> very young people, has to take it.
Otherwise, <unk> <unk>
And what happens to the end?
In the words of a <unk> "The <unk> and then gives light to more sons and <unk>
And the irony of the situation is that this mother, <unk> the same lesson of <unk> to his daughter and the same lesson of honor to their children.
And this vicious circle continues and continues.
<unk> siblings and sisters, when he was born <unk> and for the first time, believe me, I don't like the newborns, to be honest, but when I was there and looked at his eyes, believe me, I felt utterly <unk>
And so much before I came back, I thought about his name, and I was fascinated by a <unk> <unk> of the freedom in Afghanistan.
His name was <unk> de <unk> and he called my daughter like that.
But when I got older, they were all men, and I grabbed my feather, and I took a line from my name, and I wrote, <unk>
And when she grew, when she was four and a half, I took it in my school.
So you might ask, why should I mention a girl in a school?
Yeah, I have <unk>
You can take it for granted, in Canada, in the United States, in many developed countries, but in the poor countries, in societies in societies in tribal societies, is a great event for life.
<unk> in a school, means the recognition of his identity and his name.
One to the school means that it has entered the world of dreams and aspirations where it can explore their potential for their future life.
I have five sisters, and no one of them could go to school, and they would be <unk> two weeks before, when you took the form of tourist <unk> and he was in the relative to family, I couldn't remember the <unk> of some of my sisters.
And the reason was that I had never seen the names of my sisters written in any document.
That was the reason for the courage to my daughter.
What my father could not give my sisters or his daughters, I thought I had to change it.
I used to appreciate the intelligence and the <unk> of my daughter.
<unk> to sit with me when my friends came to me.
The encouraged to go with me to different meetings.
And all these values, I've tried to focus on their personality.
And this was not just for her, just for <unk>
I've got all these good values in my school to girls and boys in the same way.
I used education for <unk>
I went to my daughters, I taught the students, to forget the lesson of <unk>
I taught the students to forget the lesson from the so-called <unk>
<unk> brothers and sisters, <unk> for more rights for women, and <unk> to have more and more space for women in society.
But we found a new phenomenon.
It was lethal for human rights, and in particular for women's rights.
It was called <unk>
That means a complete denial of participation in all of political, economic and social activities.
Hundreds of schools.
The girls are banned to school.
Women were forced to use <unk> and they stopped going to markets.
The musicians were <unk> the <unk> girls and the singers killed.
<unk> millions, but a few <unk> and it was terrifying to have around those people who kill and <unk> when you talk about their rights.
It's really terrifying.
Ten years old -- he got up and raised for the right to education.
He wrote a newspaper.
And his voice was the most powerful voice.
They were <unk> like a <unk> around the world.
And that was the reason why the Taliban could not tolerate his campaign and nine of October 2012, he was shot in the head.
It was a day <unk> for my family and me.
The world became a great black hole.
Whereas my daughter was <unk> between life, and death, I was going to love my wife to my wife, "I've got <unk> because of what happened to my daughter, <unk>
And <unk> said to me, "Please do it <unk>
<unk> the right thing.
They put your life in play for the cause of the truth, because of peace, and for the cause of education, and your daughter was inspired by you and <unk>
They were both on the right road and God <unk>
These few words <unk> for me, and I didn't go back to ask again.
When <unk> was in the hospital, and he had severe blood headaches because his facial nerve was cut, I used to see a dark shadow on my wife.
But my daughter never <unk>
I used to say, "I'm okay with my <unk> smile, and with my face.
I'm going to be okay. Please don't get away.
It was a comfort for us, and we <unk>
<unk> brothers and sisters, we have learned from it how to resist the most hard moments and I'm pleased to share with you that despite being an icon for the rights of children and women, is like every <unk>
<unk> when he didn't have his homework.
They fight your siblings, and I'm very happy for that.
People ask me, "What is there about my <unk> who has made it so bold to <unk> so brave and expressive and <unk>
I tell you what I did.
I did what I didn't did.
I didn't cut their wings and that's it.
Thank you very much.
Thank you. Thank you very much. Thank you.
I was <unk> of the brain, 18 years ago, and since that day, the science of the brain has become a personal passion.
I'm engineering.
And I want to tell you that I've recently joined the <unk> group of Google, where I've had a <unk> to my <unk> <unk> <unk> -- but all the work that I'm going to talk about today about the science of the brain, I did that before I went to Google or outside of my work there.
Having said this, there is a stigma when you hit an operation of brain.
You're still like smart or not?
If you don't, you'll be intelligent to be smart.
After the <unk> I was missing a part of the brain, and I had to live with it.
It was not the gray matter, but it was the dead part of the center that creates important hormones and <unk>
Immediately after the operation, I had to figure out how much to do, of more than a dozen powerful chemicals every day, because if I didn't take anything, would die in a few hours.
Every day, for the last 18 years, I have had to decide about combinations of chemicals and mix them out of chemicals and try to keep them on to keep them alive.
More than once saved me.
But luckily, I have a soul soul by what I decided to try to get to try to get the dose of it, because it really doesn't exist a clear map to say it in <unk>
I started testing different <unk> and I was shocked to see how small changes in the dose, dramatically my <unk> my sense of who I was like, my way to think, my behavior with others.
A particularly <unk> case for a few months, I tried a dose and typical chemicals for a <unk> man, and I was surprised to see how my thoughts.
I was always <unk> I thought all the time in sex, and I thought it was the smartest person around the world, and --  -- of course, a lot of times in the past I've known several guys like this, or maybe some <unk> versions.
It turned out as a extreme.
But my great surprise was that I was not trying to be <unk>
In fact, I was <unk> a little bit <unk> fixing a problem that had the front, and it just doesn't happen that way.
So I couldn't deal with it.
I changed my <unk>
But I think that experience gave me a new appreciation for the men and what they have to do is -- since then I am better with men.
So what I was trying to do is to adjust those hormones, those hormones, and these <unk> and so forth, was regain my intelligence after the disease, and <unk> my creative thinking -- my <unk> of ideas.
We think almost always in images, and that became my key point of the key: how do you have those mental imaging that I use to create <unk> my ideas, if they were <unk> new ideas and <unk> situations.
This kind of thoughts is not new.
<unk> like <unk> Descartes and <unk> look at things in similar ways.
They thought the images and mental ideas were the same thing.
Today there are the people who challenge this idea, and there are a lot of arguments about how the mind works, for me is simple: for most of us, mental imaging are fundamental to the thought and <unk> thinking.
So after several years, I got to find the right point and have a lot of great mental <unk> you know, really <unk> and <unk>
Now, I'm working on how to take these mental images, of my mind to the screen of the computer.
Can you imagine what would happen if a cinema director would be able to use its imagination just to drive the world that has the <unk>
Or if a musician, I could extract the music of his head?
There are incredible possibilities.
And the truth is, the only difficulty for doing this is simply to increase the resolution of our brain scanning systems.
Let me show you why I think we're pretty close to this with two recent experiments done by two leading groups in neuroscience.
They both used MRI technology, image by functional magnetic resonance to represent the brain, here you can see the brain scanning for <unk> <unk> and his colleagues from Harvard.
The spine on the left shows the scanning of a person who looks at an image.
The column of the medium shows the scanning of the brain of that same individual as you can see that same image.
The spine on the right was created <unk> the contents of the core column on the left, it looks like the difference is almost <unk>
This is <unk> in many different individuals with lots of different images, always with a similar outcome.
The difference between looking at a picture and imagine looking at that same picture.
Now, let me share with you another experiment. This is the lab from Jack <unk> in Berkeley, California.
They were able to turn brain waves in <unk> visual fields.
Let's put it in this way.
In this experiment, I showed people hundreds of hours of YouTube videos while they were <unk> their brains to create a great pool of brain reactions to the sequences of video.
Then, I showed you a film with new images, new people, new animals, and while they were both <unk> a new <unk>
The computer is just using the brain brain information that would be <unk> to show what it seemed like the person was looking at.
On the right you can see the <unk> of the computer, and on the left, the video that I showed you.
This gave us <unk>
We're good at doing this.
We just need to improve the resolution.
And now, remember, when you see a picture and when you can imagine that same picture, you create the same <unk>
This is done with the brain scanning systems systems that have been available today, and their resolution was a thousand times in the last few years.
Now we need to increase the resolution for a thousand times more to get a deeper look.
How do you do that?
There are lots of techniques to do it.
One is going to open the skull and introduce electrodes.
I don't offer it for that.
Many of them are proposing new techniques of projection for images, even me -- with the recent result of the MRI -- we must first have to ask ourselves, this technology will be the end of the road?
The conventional wisdom says that the only way to get greater resolution is with bigger magnets, but at this point, most <unk> magnets just offer small improvement on resolution -- not gains for thousands as need.
I propose this idea, rather than larger magnets, let's make better magnets.
We can create much more complex structures with slightly different arrangements like making a <unk>
And why does this matter?
In the last few years, a lot of effort on MRI were to make really big magnets, right?
But most of the recent advances in <unk> of intelligent solutions and brilliant brilliant solutions and <unk> in the <unk> and <unk> radio frequency in MRI system.
At the time, instead of a magnetic field that we can look at <unk> magnetic patterns.
So by combining the magnetic patterns with the patterns of processing radio processing -- we can increase a massive form of information that can take in a single <unk>
And then we can split up in layers of our rising knowledge on the structure of the brain and memory to create the increase in the ones that we need.
When we use <unk> we should be able to measure not only the fluid fluid -- but the <unk> hormones that I mentioned and perhaps even direct neural activity. This is the dream.
We're going to be able to <unk> our ideas in a direct way to digital media.
Can you imagine if we could move above language and communicate directly through the <unk>
What would we be <unk>
And how do we learn how to deal with the truths of human thinking without <unk>
You thought the Internet is a big thing.
These are great questions.
It would be irresistible to use it as a tool to amplify our thinking of thinking and communication.
Certainly, this same tool could lead to the cure for Alzheimer's and similar disease.
We have a few more options than open this door.
Anyway, choose a year to happen in five or 15 years?
It's hard to imagine that it will take a lot more.
We have to learn how to take this step together.
Thank you.
I'm going to talk to you tonight about getting out of the closet, and not in a traditional sense, not just the gay closet.
I think we all have <unk>
It probably is to say to some person for the first time for the first time for the first time to tell someone who is pregnant, or tell someone who has cancer, or any other conversation that you have ever done in life.
I think it's a hard conversation -- and even though our issues can vary <unk> the experience of I've lived and have come out of that summary is universal.
It fear is not afraid, and we don't like it must happen.
A few years ago, I worked in the South Side years ago, I was working on the South Side of the city, and being there, I had to go through several stages of the <unk> <unk> -- I didn't take my armpits, I just quote from <unk> and <unk> <unk> as a <unk>
And it's going to be slope from my <unk> my <unk> and I got my head away, I would ask myself a little kid, "Hey, you're a kid or <unk>
And it would appear a awkward silence at the table.
I would hold my jaw a little bit longer, I would take my coffee with a <unk>
The <unk> father, <unk> the paper and the mother tossed a cold look at his son.
But I wouldn't say anything, and <unk> in the inside.
And I got to the point that every time I went to a place where there was a kid between three and 10 years, I was ready to fight.
And that's a terrible feeling.
So I promised that the next time I would say something.
I would have that hard conversation.
So after a few weeks, it happened again.
"You're a kid or a <unk>
A family silence but this time was prepared and was about to get on full of the female issues at the table.  He had the quotes of Betty <unk>
<unk> <unk>
Even a clip of the "Vagina Monologues," which is <unk>
So I took a deep down, and I got the look at my backs, and my backs was a <unk> girl, looking at what is not a challenge.
So I took a deeper back -- again, I got a little bit of <unk> near it, and I said, "Hey, I know that this is confusing stuff.
I have the short hair like the one kid, and I saw a kid, but I'm a girl, and you know, how you like to wear a pink dress and sometimes you like to wear a comfortable pajamas.
Now, I'm more of the kind of <unk>
And that girl looked at me <unk> by paying attention, and he said, "My favorite ninja is <unk> and he has a fish.
Can you give me a <unk> for <unk>
And that was everything, they are a girl.
What about the <unk> <unk>
It was the most easy conversation.
And by <unk> because the girl in the <unk> and I, both of us were <unk> one with the other.
So like many of us, I've lived in some <unk> in my life, and yes, often, my walls used to be a <unk>
But inside, in the dark. You can't know what color are the walls.
You just know how one feels living in a closet.
This is how I thought is not different from yours or yours or yours.
<unk> I'm going to give you 100 reasons why I was going to go out of my closet was more difficult to come out of his, but this is the <unk> The hard thing is not <unk>
The hard thing is hard.
Who can tell me that to explain to someone who has declared on banking is more difficult to tell it that he has been <unk>
Who can tell me that this story I'm telling is more difficult to tell your three-year-old son than you are going to be <unk>
There's no more difficult thing, there is only hard for you.
We have to stop serving what is hard for me to what difficult for another person to make us feel better or worse in relation to our properties, and we have to just feel empathy because we all live in a hard thing.
At some point in our life, we all live in <unk> and they can make it feel security, or at least more security than the other side of the door.
But I'm here to tell you that it doesn't matter what their walls, <unk> is not a place to live.
Thank you.  Imagine 20 years ago.
I, who had a horse tail a dress and shoes.
It was not the militant band prepared to fight any child in four years who would go into coffee.
I was frozen because of fear <unk> in a corner of my dark wallet -- my grenade passed out, and the one muscle is the most scary thing that ever done.
My family, my friends with strangers I've spent my whole life trying to do not <unk> and now the world was turning back to purpose.
I was burning the pages of a script that we've all been on for so much time, but if you don't throw that <unk> you kill.
One of my most memorable book shuttle was in the wedding of my sister.
It was the first time that many people were invited to know that it was gay, and by doing my <unk> <unk> in my black dress and <unk> I walked around the tables and eventually I got to one where my friends were friends in my parents, and I knew I knew years old.
And after speaking a moment, one of the women cried -- <unk> Nathan <unk>
And the battle of the gay story had begun.
Have you ever been in the <unk>
"Well, yes, the truth is that we have friends in San <unk>
"Well, we've never gone there, but we've heard that it's <unk>
<unk> You know my <unk> <unk>
It's very good and never talked about having <unk>
What is your favorite TV show.
Our favorite show Will and Grace <unk>
And you know who <unk> us.
Jack is our <unk>
And then a woman, <unk> but at the wait for me desperately to be able to get me to know that I was on my side, finally said, "Well, sometimes my husband uses a <unk>
And I had an opportunity at that moment, as you have all the <unk> <unk>
<unk> might have been easy to indicate where they felt <unk>
It's not very difficult to find them and realize the fact that they were <unk>
And what else can you ask for somebody, but <unk>
If you are going to be authentic with somebody, you have to be prepared for the authentic thing to do.
It's like the hard conversations continue to be my strong point.
Ask anyone that I have <unk>
But I'm getting better, and I follow what I like to call the three principles of <unk>
Now, please look at this through the <unk> perspective -- but understand that what it implies is going out of all the same.
Number one: Be true.
<unk> <unk> Be yourself.
That girl in the coffee had no armor but I was ready for battle.
If you want someone to be <unk> the other needs to know that we also have it.
Number two: Be <unk> just <unk> <unk> <unk>
If you know they're gay, <unk>
If you say to your parents that maybe they might be gay, they will keep the hope that that might change.
Don't give them a sense of false hope.
And number three, and more important -- let the complex complex.
You communicate your truth.
It would never be done by that.
And some of them can go out of a safe hurt by what they have done, but I never get excited about what they are.
And yes, maybe some of you will feel <unk> but that something in them, not in you.
Those are the expectations of them about what you are, but not their own.
That's the story of them, but not of you.
The only story that matters is that you want to type.
So the next time you find on a dark way -- a <unk> you must know that we've all been there before.
And you may feel very themselves, but they're not.
Thank you, <unk> Enjoy the <unk>
So what is that?
If you look at the history of how intelligence, you've seen the intelligence, a productive example -- has been the famous quote from <unk> <unk> that "The question of whether a machine can think is as interesting as the question of whether a submarine can be <unk>
When <unk> <unk> wrote this as a criticism.
And so a few years ago, I cofounded a program to try to understand the underlying physical mechanisms of intelligence.
So let's get a walk.
First, let's start with a mental experiment.
Imagine that they're from an alien race that you don't know about the biology of the Earth and the Earth of the Earth and the intelligence of the Earth, but they have incredible telescopes and you can see the Earth, and they have incredibly lives -- so you can see the Earth for millions, even billions of years.
And you see a very strange effect.
Of course, as <unk> we know that the reason we are trying to save ourselves.
We're trying to avoid an impact.
But if you're from a alien race that doesn't know anything about this, which has no concept of intelligence on the Earth, it would be forced to develop a physical theory that would explain how to some moment in time, the asteroids that we <unk> the surface of a planet <unk>
And that's why I say that this is the same question that will understand the physical nature of intelligence.
So in this program that I conducted several years ago, I looked at a variety of issues through science, through several disciplines, that <unk> to a single underlying mechanism of intelligence.
In <unk> for example, there have been a variety of evidence that our universe seems to be perfectly tuned to the development of intelligence, and in particular for the development of universal states that are <unk> the diversity of possible future.
Finally, in the robotic movement, there's been a variety of recent techniques that have tried to harness the skills of the robots to maximize the future freedom to maximize the future freedom in order to perform complex tasks.
And so, taking all these different things and <unk> together, I asked them, and I said, there's an underlying mechanism for the intelligence that we can extract from all these different <unk>
There's just an equation for <unk>
And I think the answer is yes. What you're looking at is probably the closest equivalent to a E = <unk> for the intelligence that I ever saw.
So what you're looking at here is a claim that intelligence is a force, which acts with the end of maximize the future freedom of action.
It means to maximize the future freedom of action, or keeping the open choices with a T, with the diversity of potential future accessible, yes, even an impending future, <unk>
In short, the intelligence doesn't like to remain <unk>
intelligence is trying to maximize the future freedom of action and keeping food options.
And so if you look at this equation, it's natural to ask, "What can you do with this?
How <unk> is it?
<unk> the level of human intelligence.
<unk> intelligence.
So I'm going to show you now a video that I think, will show some of the surprising apps of this simple equation.
Narrator: <unk> research in cosmology have suggested that universes that produce <unk> or <unk> in their life should have more favorable conditions for the existence of intelligent beings.
But what if that <unk> connection between the entropy and intelligence <unk> a more <unk> ratio.
What if intelligent behavior is not just correlated with the production of entropy in the long term, but actually emerges directly from it?
To find out, we have developed a software engine called <unk> designed to maximize the production of long-term entropy in any system where you can find in.
Amazingly, <unk> was able to spend multiple trials, animal intelligence, play games, and even making money <unk> actions, all of it without that would have been right to do that.
Here are some examples of <unk> in action.
Just like a human standing of <unk> here, we see <unk> <unk> a pole using a <unk>
This behavior is remarkable in part because we never gave it a goal.
He just decided to balance the <unk>
This ability to balance will have apps for human robotics and human assistance technologies.
This capacity for tools will have applications in intelligent manufacturing, intelligent manufacturing, agriculture.
In addition to the same thing as some other animals can cooperate pulling from the opposite of a string at the same time to release the food, here we see that <unk> can perform a version of that task.
This ability of cooperation has interesting implications for economic planning and in a variety of other fields.
<unk> is widely applicable into a variety of <unk>
For example, here we see this successfully playing a game of <unk> against itself, <unk> their potential for play.
So here we see <unk> orchestrate new connections in a social network where the friends are constantly <unk> and they're keeping success the connected network.
This same capacity of network systems, also has apps in health care -- in energy and intelligence.
So here we see <unk> organizing the routes of a fleet of ships, discovering we succeed and using the Panama Canal to extend on the world level to the Pacific.
In the same way, <unk> is widely applicable to problems in defense and logistics and transport.
Finally, here we see <unk> spontaneously to find out and running a strategy of <unk> <unk> in a simulated series of negotiating actions, successfully increasing assets under their exponentially.
This skill skill skill will have huge apps in <unk>
Alex <unk> What you've seen is that a variety of brands of intelligent cognitive behaviors such as the use of tools, walking upright and social cooperation -- all derive from one equation, that leads to a system to maximize your future freedom of action.
Now, here's a deep <unk>
So let's go back at the beginning of the use of the term of the term -- the <unk> play, there was always the concept that if we were going to say, machines smart, there would be a <unk> rebellion, <unk>
Machines are <unk> against us.
One of the biggest consequences of this work is that maybe all of these decades, have had all the concept of rebellion -- to the other way.
It's not that machines first become smart and then <unk> and trying to take over the world.
It's all the opposite, that the momentum of taking control of every future possible is a more fundamental principle than the intelligence of intelligence, which general intelligence can actually emerge directly from taking control instead of going backwards.
Another important consequence is the pursuit of the goal.
I often ask me, how do you look for targets are learning from these kinds of <unk>
My equivalent to that statement to go to the descendants to go to the descendants to help them build artificial fireworks or to help us understand human intelligence -- is the following: intelligence must be viewed as a physical process that tries to maximize the future freedom of action and avoid restrictions in their own future.
Thank you very much.
We're at an inflection point in human history, something between the rest of the stars, and losing the planet that we call <unk>
Except, in the last few years, we've extended a lot of our knowledge of how the Earth fits the Earth in the context of the universe.
The Kepler Kepler has discovered thousands of potential planets orbiting other stars, what points to Earth is only one between the billions of planets in our galaxy.
Kepler is a spacecraft telescope, which measures the faint intensity of the stars, when the planets go through in front of them, and blocking a little bit of that light coming to us.
The data gathered by Kepler show the sizes of planets in addition to the distance that there is between them and their own mother.
In together, this helps us understand if these planets are small and <unk> like the Earth's planets in our solar system, and also the amount of light that they get from their technology.
At the time, this gives you clues about if these planets we found are habitable or not.
Unfortunately while we're finding this trove of worlds that lived in potentially <unk> our own planet.
<unk> was the warmer recorded.
<unk> and sea ice that have been to us for millennia are now disappearing in a matter of decades.
So these environmental changes that we've caused global scale have <unk> our ability to alter their process.
But I am not any scientist scientist and no <unk>
I study the <unk> of the planet influenced by the stars, with hope to find out in the universe where to discover life beyond our planet.
You might say that I look for alien opportunities in the property sector.
Now, as a very interested in the search for life in the universe I can tell you that the more I look at planets on the Earth, most of our own planet.
Each of these new worlds invited a comparison between the last single planet and the planets that we know better -- our solar system.
Take our neighbor, Mars.
Mars is small and <unk> and despite being a little farther away from the sun, it can be a potentially livable world shown that for a mission like <unk>
In fact, it's possible that Mars has been livable in the past, and in part, that's why we studied so much to Mars.
Our <unk> like <unk> are tracking their surface for clues about the origins of life as well as we know it.
The satellites that <unk> as the <unk> of the mission -- they take samples of the <unk> atmosphere.
<unk> companies are now offering not just short flight flight but also the ability to live on Mars.
But even though all of these <unk> images remind us of our planet, places that are linked in our imagination with ideas and <unk> and <unk> compared to the Earth, Mars is a pretty terrible place to live.
So let's take the extension of the Earth's areas of our planet that are still <unk> places in comparison with Mars.
Even in the <unk> and higher places on Earth is cool and full of oxygen <unk> by our tropical forests to thousands of miles away.
I'm worried that this excitement for the colonization of Mars and other planets will travel with a big and sad <unk> the implication, and the belief that Mars would expect to save this <unk> <unk> of the only planet we know that is truly livable Earth.
For a lot that I can like exploration <unk> I'm in deep disagreement with this idea.
There are a lot of good reasons to go to Mars, but to say that Mars will be there to bring humanity to humanity is like imagine that the captain of Titanic told us that the captain of it will be more late in the <unk>   Thank you.
But the goals for aging exploration and the land preservation is not <unk>
No, they're actually faces of the same <unk> the goal of life, preserve and improve life in the future.
The extremes environments in our world looks like <unk> aliens.
They just find them closer to home.
If we can understand how to create and maintain <unk> spaces in the hostile areas of the ground, maybe we can meet the need to preserve our environment and go beyond that.
I leave you with an experiment, the paradox of <unk>
A lot of years ago, the physicist Enrico Fermi asked us to realize that our universe has been around for a long time, and we hope that there were many planets in this universe, we should have found evidence for alien life until now.
Well, where are they?
Well, one possible solution to the paradox of Fermi is that when civilizations become serious enough to be able to be able to be living between the stars, lose the notion of the important thing that is protecting the origin of the planets that are <unk>
It's kind of arrogant to think that only colonization we will save us from ourselves, but the planetary preservation and exploration, can work together.
If we really believe in our ability to look at the hostile environments of Mars for human presence -- then we should be able to overcome the task even easier to preserve the <unk> on Earth.
Thank you.
A few years ago, I took my own home.
And while I was on the front porch looking at my pockets, I realized I didn't have the keys.
In fact, I could see the window, they were at the dining table, where I had <unk>
So I tried to open all the other doors and windows, and they were all okay off.
I thought about <unk> at least I had my phone, but at midnight, a <unk> it could take a long time to get it cold.
I could not go back to my friend of Jeff to spend night, because I had an flight early to Europe the next morning, and my passport and my suitcase.
<unk> expensive, but sure not more expensive than a half of the night, so I thought, despite the circumstances, I worked right out.
I'm a neuroscientist, and I know a little bit about how the brain works under stress.
<unk> <unk> who increases the heart rates, and <unk> the adrenaline levels and <unk> the thought.
And when I got to the counter counter in the airport, I realized that I didn't have my passport.
Well, I had a long time to think about those eight hours without sleep.
And I began to ask myself, if there was something that I could do, systems that could put in his place, that I would make it happen.
Or at least, if you are going on bad things, which is going to be the probability of a total disaster.
So I got to think about that, but until a month later, my thoughts didn't know.
I was having dinner with my colleague Danny <unk> won the Nobel <unk> and a little embarrassed to talk about that I broke the window, and so I had forgotten my passport. And Danny shared with me that I'd been practicing something called <unk>
It's something that he had learned from the psychologist Gary <unk> who had written about this a few years before, known as <unk>
Everyone knows what <unk>
Every time there is a disaster, a team of experts -- and tries to figure out what went wrong, yeah?
In the <unk> like <unk> you look forward and tries to find out all the things that you might go wrong, then try to figure out what it can do to prevent things out or to minimize the damage.
So what I want to talk to you with is some things that we can do in the form of a <unk>
Some of them are <unk> others are not so apparent.
I'm going to start with the obvious ones.
In the house, I would take a place for things that are <unk>
This sounds very common and it is, but there's a lot of science that supports this <unk> based on how our space memory.
There's a structure in the brain called hippocampus, which has evolved over the course of thousands of years, to do a track of the location of the important things, where the well, where the fish are, which are the ones where the tribes are friends and <unk>
The hippocampus is the part of the brain that goes into the <unk> in London.
It's the part of the brain that allows you to find your nuts.
And if you ask if someone really did the experiment, they were <unk> the <unk> sense of <unk> and they still find your nuts.
They didn't use the smell, but the hippocampus, that mechanism evolved in order to find things.
But it's really good for things that don't move a lot, not so good for things that move a lot.
This is the reason for losing your car keys and <unk>
So at home <unk> a place for the keys, a hook next to the door, maybe a <unk> dish.
So for your passport, a particular secret.
For your reading writing, a <unk>
If you get a place and you are <unk> with it, your stuff will always be there when the <unk>
What about <unk>
Take a picture of your cell cards a picture of your credit card cards, and you get to drive, you know, your mail in the cloud.
If these things are lose or <unk> this can make it facilitate <unk>
These are some of the most obvious things.
Remember, when you're under stress, the brain releases <unk>
<unk> is toxic and <unk> thought.
So part of civic practice is to recognize that low stress will not be at the best time, and you have to put systems in the site.
And there's perhaps not more stressful than when you're faced with a medical decision.
And at some point, we're all going to be in that situation, to have to make a really important decision about the future of our medical care or the <unk> to help them with a decision.
And so I want to talk about that.
And to talk about a very particular medical condition.
But this is <unk> as a <unk> for all of the decision-making in medical decisions, and in fact to make the decision-making of financial decisions and social decisions, any kind of decision that you have to take a rational assessment of the facts.
So suppose you go to the doctor and the doctor says, "I've got the result of the lab and cholesterol is a little <unk>
Everyone knows that cholesterol cholesterol is associated with a greater risk of heart disease, heart attack.
So you're thinking that having high cholesterol is not the best, then the doctor says, "I would like to give you a drug that will help <unk> <unk>
And you may have heard of the <unk> and you know it's one of the most <unk> drugs in the world today, even you are likely to know people who are <unk>
So you say, "Yes, <unk> <unk>
But there's a question that you have to do then, a statistic that you have to ask for that most doctors don't want to talk about, and the drug companies even less.
It's for the <unk> the number necessary to treat.
And what is this, <unk>
It's the number of people who have to take a drug or listen to surgery in any medical procedure before it helps a person.
And you must think of what kind of statistical statistic is <unk>
The number must be one.
My doctor didn't tell me something if I wasn't going to help me.
But actually, medical practice doesn't work like this.
And it's not <unk> and if it's the fault of somebody, it's from scientists like me.
We haven't understood the mechanisms.
But the estimates of <unk> that 90 percent of drugs works just from 30 to 50 percent of the people.
So the number you need to treat the most widely most widely <unk> which you think is it?
How many people have to take it before they help a person?
300.
That according to the research of the cynical researchers <unk> and Pamela <unk> <unk> independently <unk>
I just explored the numbers.
300 people have to take the drug for a year before avoiding a single heart attack, or another <unk> event.
Now you might think, "Well, one probability in 300 to get my <unk>
Why don't we say, <unk> <unk> the recipe for all <unk>
But then you have to ask for a statistic more, and it is, let's get the <unk> effects.
For this particular drug, the side effects are produced in five percent of the patients.
And those include <unk> <unk> and <unk> pain and <unk> pain <unk> but now they think they're five percent not likely to go to me, still take the <unk>
But a moment.
remember that low stress don't think clearly.
So think about how we do this over time, so you don't have to make the chain of reasoning on the act.
300 people take the drug, isn't it? A person has <unk> five percent of the 300 have the side effects, that are 15 people.
You have 15 times more likely to go out to the drug that the drug will help you.
I don't say that they should or not take <unk>
I just say they must have this conversation with their doctor.
Public ethic is part of the principle of informed consent.
We have a right to have access to this kind of information to start the conversation about if you want to take the risks or not.
You may be thinking that I've launched this number in the air for the value value, but actually this number necessary to treat is quite typical.
For the surgery that more is done in the biggest men in the United States over the United States of prostate cancer, the number you need to deal with is <unk>
This is, 49 surgeries for one person who has <unk>
And the side effects in that case, are produced in 50 percent of the patients.
Those include <unk> or <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
And if you're lucky, and it's one of that 50 percent of the effects just <unk> a year or two.
So the idea of <unk> is to think of time before the questions that you can ask to make the conversation forward.
You don't have to do everything on the act.
And they also want to think about quality of life.
Because you have a choice for a lot of times, they want a shorter life free of pain, or a longer life that could have a lot of pain towards the end?
These are the things that they talk and think about now, with their family and their loved ones.
You can change in the heat of the moment, but at least you're trained in this kind of thought.
Remember, our brain releases <unk> under stress and one of the things that happens at that moment is that they turn out a lot of systems.
There's an evolutionary reason for this.
Face with the face with a predator, is not necessary or <unk> or <unk> or the immune system, because if the body is spending the metabolism in those things, it doesn't react fast.
Unfortunately one of the things that is going on the window, for those moments of stress is the logical thought, as Danny <unk> and his colleagues have been shown.
So we have to <unk> to think about the future to this kind of situations.
I think the important thing here is to recognize that we're all <unk>
We're all going to fail in time.
The idea is to think about the future, how they might be those <unk> to put systems in the place that will help minimize harm or to prevent the bad things in the first place.
I went to the night of snow in <unk> when I came back from my journey, my contractor set up a combination of a combination along the door, with a key door in the same, an easy way to remember it.
And I have to admit that I still have lots of letters that I haven't ordered -- and lots of text messages I haven't read.
So I'm not very organized, but I see the organization as a <unk> process, and I'm doing it.
Thank you very much.
Interpreter: <unk> <unk> is my favorite symbol.
It means playing <unk>
If you're playing a musical instrument, and you see a <unk> in the <unk> you need to play more <unk>
Two <unk> even more smoothly.
Four <unk>
This is my drawing of a <unk> tree there, you see that no matter how many thousands and thousands of <unk> can be <unk> to a complete silence.
That's my current definition of <unk> a very dark sound.
I'd like to share a little bit about the story of the American system, the <unk> in addition to a little bit of my own story.
The French signs came over the 1960s -- and over the time of the time, it was mixed with local signs, and developed the language that we now know as <unk>
So it has a story about about 200 years.
I was born <unk> and I was taught to believe that sound wasn't a part of my life.
And I thought it was true.
But now I realize that it's not true for anything.
The sounds are a very important part of my life, really in my mind every day.
As a <unk> person who lives in a real mind, is like I lived in a foreign country, following blindly <unk> and <unk> behaviors and norms without <unk>
So how do I understand the sound.
Well, I see how people behave and respond to sound.
People are like my <unk> and <unk> sound.
<unk> and <unk> that behavior.
At the same time, I've learned that I can create sound, and I've seen how people are."
So I've learned, for example.
"Not <unk> <unk>
"Don't do a lot of noise by eating the bag of chips in <unk>
"Not <unk> and when you're eating, Make sure you don't have <unk> <unk>
I call it <unk> <unk>
Maybe I think about the label of sound than the average person does.
I'm a super <unk>
And I'm always waiting for <unk> the sound, which is to come next.
From there, this painting.
<unk> by decide.
<unk> for moving on.
<unk> <unk>
You can see that <unk> has no notes in the lines.
That's because the lines already contain sounds through <unk> <unk> and <unk>
In the <unk> culture, the movement is equivalent to sound.
This is the signal for <unk> in the <unk>
A typical <unk> has five lines.
But to me, do the self with my thumb that doesn't feel natural.
That's why I have four lines on the paper.
In the year 2008, I had the opportunity to travel to Berlin, Germany, for a artistic house there.
Before this time, I had worked like <unk>
During this summer, I visited museums.
At that point, the sound was the trend and that was the trend and that was <unk>
There was no visual art, everything was <unk>
Now the sound has entered my own <unk>
I'm going to tell you more about art?
I realized that it doesn't have to be like this.
In fact, I know the sound.
I know it so well that you don't just experience through the ears.
I can feel this <unk> or experience visually, or even as an idea.
So I decided to reclaim property property and <unk> in my artistic practice.
And everything that had taught me in terms of sound, I decided to leave it and get it out.
I started creating a new body of work.
And when I presented it to the artistic community, I was struck with the amount of support and attention that I got.
I realized that sound is like money, power, the <unk> currency <unk>
In the bottom of my mind, I always felt like the sound was <unk> it was something of a listener person.
And the sound is so powerful that it could be <unk> to me and my artistic work, or I could <unk>
I chose to join me.
There's a massive culture around speech.
And just because I don't use my literal voice to communicate, the eyes of society is as if I didn't have a voice at all.
So I have to work with people who can support me just like and becoming my voice.
So I'm able to be relevant in society today.
So in school, in work and institutions, work with lots of different performers <unk>
And his voice becomes my voice and identity.
They help me be <unk>
And their voices have value and weight.
Ironically, for <unk> his voices, I'm able to maintain a temporary way of value as well as taking a loan from a very high interest rate.
If I'm not going to keep this practice, I feel like I could get it on the <unk> and not have any kinds of social value.
So with sound like my new artistic medium <unk> in the world of music.
And I was surprised by looking at the similarities between music and <unk>
For example, a music note cannot capture and express fully on the paper.
And the same thing can be said for a concept in <unk>
The two are very <unk> and highly <unk> which means that subtle changes can affect the whole meaning of signals as the sounds.
I'd like to share with you a metaphor for the piano to understand better how the <unk> works.
So, imagine a piano.
<unk> divide in many different parameters <unk>
If you are <unk> a different <unk> for every finger while the facial expression, the motion of the body, the shape of your hand and so, while the piano hits the piano, English is a linear language -- as if you get on the piano at the time.
However, <unk> is more like a chord, you need the 10 fingers in the way to express to express a clear concept.
If you just change the question, it would create a completely different meaning of it.
Same thing happens with music in terms of tone <unk> and volume.
In <unk> when you use these different parameters -- you can express different ideas.
For example, the <unk> signal in that."
This is the <unk> signal in that."
I'm looking at you.
<unk> <unk>
Oh, <unk>
<unk>
So what are you <unk>
Oh, <unk>
So I got to think, and if I look at <unk> through the lenses of music?
If I had to create a sign and put it over and again, it could be a piece of visual music.
For example, this is the sign of <unk> the sun goes out and you <unk>
This is "All day."
If you put it on, and you look at the speed -- visually and you see it as a piece of music.
Every day.
I feel that the same thing can be said for <unk> <unk>
All the <unk>
This is all night, in this painting.
And this led me to think about three different kinds of <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> --  <unk> <unk>
I feel the third has more <unk> than the other two.
This represents the time in <unk> and how the distance into the body can express changes in time.
For example, one <unk> is a hand.
So the first example is <unk> a lot of time.
Then, <unk> <unk> <unk> and the last, which is my favorite, with a very romantic and dramatic idea at the time, <unk> again."
<unk> <unk> is a music term with a specific rate of four times by <unk>
And yet, when I see the word <unk> <unk> I think automatically in <unk> same time."
Take a look at <unk> <unk> <unk>
We have <unk> through the head and chest.
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
Can you do it with me?
All of the hands in high.
Now we're going to do so much on my head like my chest, something like <unk> <unk> or <unk> the same time."
Yeah, very well.
That means <unk> in the international system.
The international system, as a story, is a visual tool to help communicate in all cultures and languages of signs around the world.
The second thing I would like to show you is this one. Please do it again.
And now this.
It means <unk> in the <unk>
Now, the third. Please <unk> again.
And again.
It's <unk> in the <unk>
We're going to do the three together.
<unk> <unk> and <unk>
Good job.
So look at how the three signs are very similar. They all happen on the head and the chest. But they bring very different phones.
It's incredible to see how <unk> is alive and thriving as well as music.
But today, we live in a very small world.
And just because the <unk> has no sounds, it doesn't automatically have social value.
We have to start questioning what defines social value and allow the <unk> to develop their own value, without sounds.
And this could be a step to make a more <unk> society.
And maybe people will understand that you don't have to be deaf, to learn how to learn how to learn music.
<unk> is a rich performance, and I'd like you to have the same experience.
I'd like to <unk> you open your ears, and open your eyes to participate in our culture and experiment in our language to be able to experience our language in our culture.
And you never know, they can even fall in love with us.
Thank you.
<unk> <unk> Hey, that's me.
As a kid, my parents would say, "Can you get it all right, but then you have to <unk>
Freedom involves responsibility.
But my imagination led me to all these wonderful places, where everything was possible.
So I grew up in a bubble of innocence or a bubble of ignorance I have to say, because the adults would lie to us to protect us from the horrible truth.
When I get older, I learned that the adults also get to <unk> and that they're not really good to clean each other.
The time now, I'm an adult and <unk> and invention in <unk> Hong Kong.
You don't have to wait so much for my students to walk through the beach.
So as good citizens, we cleaned up the <unk> and no, it's not drinking alcohol, and if it is, I didn't get it.
It's sad to speak, but more than 80 percent of the oceans contain plastic.
It's something creepy.
And in the last decades, we've been coming out of these big vessels and networks, to collect those pieces of plastic to study them under the microscope, and the <unk> and <unk> this information on a map.
But it lasts for an eternity and it's very expensive and it's also very expensive to use those giant <unk>
So with my students, with ages six to 15 years, we dream to invent a better way.
We've transformed our tiny classroom in Hong Kong in a workshop.
We started building this little bit of <unk> work -- so that young kids are able to be able to participate in.
And I'm going to tell you the kids who create electric tools feel great and secure.
Not exactly.
So back to plastic.
We collect the plastic and we reduce it the size we see in the ocean, which is very small, because of its <unk>
That's what we do.
I leave it to the imagination of my students.
My job is to try to take the best ideas in every child and try to engage them in something that we expect it to work.
We decided that instead of collecting pieces of plastic, just <unk> information.
Through the use of a robot, we took a picture of this <unk> the kids would get a lot of with robots.
And then we create quickly what we call "a <unk>
We're so fast in the creation of prototypes that we end up before lunch.
And we transform light bulbs and web cameras in Texas, and we put it into a floating robot that will move slowly from the water and the plastic we have there, and this is the picture of the robot.
We see the pieces of plastic floating through the sensor while the computer on board process this image and measure the size of every single <unk> to get an estimate of the amount of plastic in the water.
We took this invention at a web website for inventors called <unk> with the hope that somebody would be <unk> even more.
The great thing in this project is that the students saw a local problem, and they were trying to figure out the solution immediately.
I'm able to investigate my problem, but my students in Hong Kong are very good kids.
Do you see the news, <unk> the Internet, and it would be <unk>
A kid, maybe less than 10 years old, cleaning up a oil spill -- just using hands in <unk> the largest largest <unk> forest in the world in Bangladesh.
They were very surprised because this is the water that <unk> is the water that <unk> the water where they live.
You can see that water is brown, the mud and the oil also are the brown color, and when everything is <unk> it's really hard to see what is in the water.
But there's a simple technology called <unk> which allows you to see what is in the water.
We built a first prototype of a <unk> that can be built through all kinds of substances producing different <unk> which can help you identify what is in the water.
We put this prototype with a sensor and we send it to Bangladesh.
The great thing about this project is that beyond solving a local problem, or to analyze a local problem, my students used their empathy and their sense of creativity to help other children.
I looked at a problem with <unk> I was forced to make a second experiment, and I wanted to go a little further away, maybe address a more difficult problem, and even closer to me.
I am half a French and half a French and probably remember, that in 2011, there was a devastating earthquake in Japan.
It was so violent that we began several giant waves called <unk> and those <unk> destroy several cities on the east coast of Japan.
More than 14,000 people died in a second.
It also gives the nuclear energy plant from Fukushima a nuclear power near water.
And today, according to the average reports of 300 tons of cars are still leaking from the nuclear plant in the Pacific Ocean.
Today, the entire Pacific Ocean has traces of pollution by <unk>
If we go on the West Coast, we can measure the radiation <unk> everywhere.
But if you look at the map, it seems that most of the radiation disappeared from the Japanese coast -- and most of them is in fact, it's blue. It's blue.
Well, reality is a little bit more complicated than that.
I've gone back to <unk> every year from the accident and research with other scientists, the ground, and this time we wanted to take the kids.
Of course, not the <unk> the parents don't know.
But every night in the center of <unk> here is the use of <unk>
It might seem like they did not take the serious job, but they did it because they are going to have to live with your entire life.
Along with them we discussed the data <unk> that day and talk about what we were going to do later, <unk> <unk> and so on.
And to do this, we created a <unk> map of the region around the region of nuclear power.
We created the map of <unk> <unk> to represent data in real time of <unk> and <unk> water to simulate the rain.
We were able to notice that the radioactive powder is <unk> from the top of the mountain to the <unk> system and <unk> in the ocean.
It was an estimate <unk>
But based on that we organized a civil expedition, the closer to the nuclear power to date.
We get to a mile from the nuclear power, and with the <unk> help of the area we were collecting sediments from the sea floor with a <unk> of sediment as we invented and build it.
Here's a <unk> we've gone from a local problem to a remote problem to a global problem.
And it has been really exciting to work on these different scales, also with open-source technologies and very simple.
But at the same time, it's been more and more frustrating because we've only been beginning to measure the harm that we've done.
We haven't even started trying to solve problems.
I wonder if we should take the leap and try to invent better ways to do all these things.
So the classroom became a little bit so little so much, we found an industrial installation in Hong Kong and turning it into the larger space dedicated to social impact and environmental impact.
It's in the middle of Hong Kong and it's a place where we can work with wood, metal, chemistry, a little bit of biology, basically, you can build almost all there.
It's also a place where adults and kids can play together.
It's a place where the dreams of kids can become reality with the help of adults and where adults can be kids again.
<unk> <unk> <unk>
<unk> <unk> We asked things like, we can invent the future of mobility with <unk>
For example.
Or we can help in mobility in the age of age, transforming their standard chairs in new vehicles.
<unk> and oil and <unk> are <unk> terrible, but the worst legacy we can leave our kids are the lies.
We can't afford to protect the children of the horrible truth because we need their imagination to invent the solutions.
So, American citizens, <unk> <unk> we have to make the next generation for them to worry about the environment and the people, and so that really can do something about it.
Thank you.
Two <unk> <unk> two cultures.
One is made from thousands of pieces of steel, the other one of a spider <unk>
One of them is synthetic -- the other organic.
One is the environment, the other thought of the environment.
One is designed by nature, the other for it.
Miguel <unk> he said that when he looked at the marble <unk> he saw a figure.
<unk> was only a tool of Michelangelo.
But the living ones are not <unk>
They grow.
And in the smallest units.
The tools also have consequences.
At least since the Industrial Revolution, the world of design has been dominated by <unk> of manufacturing and mass production.
The assembly lines have dictated a world made in the world, <unk> the imagination of designers and architects to think about their objects as <unk> of different parts with different functions.
But you don't find <unk> material in nature.
Think of the human skin, for example.
Our facial skins are thin with <unk> pores are.
The skins of the back are more thick with little <unk>
One acts primarily like filter the other thing as barrier, and yet, it's the same <unk> there's no <unk> no <unk>
It's a system that changes its functionality through the variation of <unk>
Here's a broken screen, which represents my view of the world -- the double personality of every designer designer and architect at working on the <unk> and the gene, between the machine, and the organism, between Henry Ford and Charles Darwin.
These two visions of the world, my left hemisphere and the right analysis, and all of us, it shows in the two screens behind me.
My work, in his simplest level, tries to bring these two two visions of the world, moving out of assembly and coming up to growth.
I probably ask, why now?
Why was it not possible for 10 or even five years?
We live in a very special moment in history, a rare moment, where they bring four disciplines that give designers access to the tools that we had never had access to before.
And at the intersection of these four fields, my team and I create.
Please know the minds and the hands of my students.
We use objects, products, and structures and tools and tools through scales, large scale, such as this robotic arm with a reach of 24 meters in diameter with a force base that one day not too far to print buildings and graphics to nanoscale made of genetically <unk> <unk>
So here we have <unk> the <unk> an archetype of the former Arab architecture, and it has created a screen where every single opening is <unk> to model the form of light and heat through it.
In our next project, we explore the possibility of creating a layer and a <unk> -- this was for a <unk> fashion fashion with <unk> <unk> <unk> It's like a second skin made of a single piece, <unk> in our flexible <unk> around the waist.
Together with collaborator of printing 3D printing -- we printed this layer and <unk> <unk> in the cells.
This hull we combined <unk> and <unk> materials in the resolution of 20 <unk>
This is the resolution of a human hair.
It's also the resolution of a <unk> machine.
That designers have access to this <unk> analytical and <unk> instruments allow us to design products that are <unk> not just the way our bodies, but also the physiological structure of our tissue.
We also designed a acoustic chair -- a chair at the time we were comfortable and also it absorb sound.
Professor <unk> my collaborator went back to nature to <unk> and by designing this <unk> pattern becomes <unk>
We take this surface of 44 different properties that vary in <unk> <unk> and color, <unk> the pressure points in the human body.
Its surface, like in nature, it changes its functionality not through addition to another material or another <unk> but <unk> <unk> and <unk> the material property.
But it's <unk> nature.
There are no parts in nature?
I didn't raised in a religious Jew home, but when I was a young woman, my grandmother told me the Bible of the Bible <unk> and one of them came to me and got to define a lot of what matters to me.
As she said, "In the third day of <unk> God sends the Earth to grow a <unk> tree <unk>
For that first tree -- there would be no difference between trunk, delicate leaves and <unk>
The whole tree was a <unk>
Instead, the earth did grow trees with twigs, cortex, <unk> and flowers.
The land created a world made of parts.
I often ask myself, "What would be the design if objects were made of a single part?
Ask a better state of <unk>
So we look for the material -- the kind of material of the tree <unk> with fruit and we found it.
The second largest <unk> on the planet is called <unk> and about 100 million tons are produced every year of organisms like shrimp, crabs, <unk> and <unk>
We think that if we could tune their properties, we could generate <unk> structures in one piece.
So that's what we did.
We call it <unk> <unk>  We asked a lot of <unk> <unk> <unk> and produced <unk>
<unk> the chemical concentrations -- we've been able to achieve a broad range of properties, from dark, hard and <unk> to the light, soft and transparent.
In order to print the large-scale structures -- this is built a system with multiple <unk> <unk> <unk>
The robot could vary the properties of material over the march and create these structures made from a single three century long, 100 percent.
When the pieces are ready, it leaves it to find a natural form of contact with the air.
So why do we keep designing with <unk>
So the air bubbles that were a byproduct of the process of printing that were used for <unk> <unk> <unk> which appeared for the first time on the planet three billion years ago, like we heard yesterday.
Along with our collaborators at Harvard and MIT, the bacteria designed genetically to capture carbon from the atmosphere and turn it into sugar.
For the first time, we have been able to generate structures that make their transition transition without <unk> <unk> and if it broadens the window.
A <unk> <unk>
Working with an old material, one of the first forms of life on the planet, in the planet, with abundant water and a little bit of synthetic biology, we've transformed a structure made of <unk> of shrimp in an architecture that behaves like a tree.
And here is the best <unk> for <unk> objects in the sea, <unk> life <unk> and placed on the ground, will help rise a tree.
The fits for our next exploration use the same design principles was the solar system.
We're looking for the possibility to create clothes to maintain life for <unk>
To do that, we need to master bacteria and control their flow.
So like the <unk> <unk> we did our own <unk> new forms of life created <unk> made <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk>
I like to think about synthetic biology as the liquid <unk> just rather than <unk> metals -- it will be <unk> new biological materials inside very small channels inside very small channels in channels in very small channels in channels in very small channels in very small channels in very small channels in very small channels in channels in very small channels in very small channels in very small channels
This field is called <unk>
We put our own 3D channels to control the flow of these <unk> <unk>
In our first piece of clothes, <unk> two <unk>
The first is <unk>
She lives in our oceans, and in the ponds of fresh water.
And second E. <unk> the bacteria that lives in the human intestine.
One becomes light in sugar, the other <unk> and produces useful biofuels for the built environment.
But these two microorganisms, don't interact in nature.
In fact, they never went extinct.
They are here, designed for the first time, to have a relationship in a piece of clothing.
Think about it as evolution, not by natural selection, but evolution per design.
To hold these relationships, we have created a single channel that looks at the tract tract that will help us make these bacteria and to make their function out.
So we began to grow those channels in the human body, <unk> the properties of material according to natural functionality.
If we wanted more <unk> to make more transparent.
This digestive system is <unk> when it stretch from one end to another, spans 60 feet.
This is half the length of a football, and 10 times more than our very thin.
And here it is, as a <unk> at TED, our first <unk> <unk> bright channels with life inside the clothing.
Thank you.
Mary <unk> said, "We are beautiful creatures -- only half is <unk>
What if design would get the other <unk>
And if we could create structures that increase the <unk>
And if we could create personal <unk> that <unk> our skin, and it will destroy our skin tissue.
Think of this as a way of editing biology.
I call this the material ecology.
So for that, you always have to go back to nature.
For now, you know that a 3D printer does it <unk> <unk>
You also know that nature doesn't do that.
<unk> <unk> <unk>
This cocoon of <unk> for example, creates a highly sophisticated architecture, a home within which they were <unk>
<unk> fabrication is about this level of <unk>
It does it through the combination of two materials, but of two proteins in different <unk>
One acts like structure, the other is the glue or the scaffold, putting those fibers in each other.
And this happens through scales.
The silk worm is first turned into the environment, creates a structure, of tension, and then begins to <unk> a cocoon of compression.
The tension and the <unk> the two forces of life, they manifest them in a single material.
With the end of understanding better how this complex process, we attach a small magnet to the head of a worm of <unk>
We put it inside a box with magnetic sensors, and that enabled us to create this cloud of points in three dimensions and visualize the complex architecture of the cocoon of silk.
But when you put the silk worm into a flat patch not within a box, we realized that you can see a flat cocoon and still <unk> <unk>
So we started designing different things, different <unk> and we've discovered that the shape of the <unk> <unk> structure was transmitted directly by the environment.
They often are <unk> the tube worms.
We saw that designing these templates we could shape the brutal silk, without a single <unk>
You know, <unk> and we could create these things.
So we drove this process up to the architectural scale.
We had a <unk> robot.
We knew that <unk> <unk> to the darker areas and <unk> so we use a solar route to reveal the distribution of light and heat in our structure.
So we created holes or <unk> to block the rays from light and heat -- which is distributed silk worms.
We were prepared to get <unk>
We were looking at <unk> worms to a online <unk>
And after <unk> four weeks, they were prepared to <unk> with us.
We put them carefully on the bottom of the <unk> and while <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and life begins again, like us, but much, much more short.
<unk> Fuller said that tension is the great integrity, and he was right.
In <unk> silk silk about silk <unk> <unk> they give all this <unk>
And in a little more than two or three weeks -- <unk> spider worms.
In a curious symmetry, this is also the length of the route of the silk.
<unk> after <unk> produce 1.5 million eggs.
This could be used for 250 additional <unk> in the future.
So here's the two visions of the world.
A <unk> silk is using a robotic arm, the other <unk>
If the last frontier of design is to bring the products to the products and the buildings that surround us to make an ecology of two materials, the designers must bring these two visions of the world.
It takes us back to the beginning.
So here's a new design era of design, a new era of creation, which takes us from a design inspired in nature to a nature inspired of us, for the very first time, that demands for the very first time, that we take care of nature.
Thank you.
Thank you very much. Thank you.
Raise your hand if you ever wondered what you want to be <unk>
If you had to remember what age they had when you asked them for the first time.
You can hold it with your fingers.
Three. Five. Three. Five.
Now, raise your hand if you ask, "What do you want to be <unk>
It has caused some kind of anxiety.
Any anxiety.
I'm somebody who could never answer the question, "What do you want to be <unk>
The problem was not that I had no interest, but I had <unk>
In the school I liked the English and the <unk> and the art and developed websites and developed the guitar, in a punk band named <unk> <unk>
You may have heard of us.
And I really like to try and persist anyway, for having dedicated long time and energy and sometimes money in this field.
But over time this sense of <unk> this feeling of, this is no longer a challenge, it comes to <unk>
And I have to let it out.
But then I went on for something else, something totally different, and I got to <unk> on it, and I let me absorb and feel <unk> I have found the <unk> and then again this point where I start <unk>
And finally, I want to let it out.
But then I would like to find something new and different, and I'd like to get a little bit at that.
This pattern was a lot of anxiety, for two reasons.
The first was because I wasn't sure how I was going to turn all this into a career.
I thought I had to choose one thing, deny all my other passions and <unk> to <unk>
Another reason that I made so much anxiety was a little more <unk>
I was worried that there was something wrong with this, and something wrong with me for nothing.
I was worried about being afraid of engagement, or to be accompanied or <unk> or my own success.
If you can relate my story and these feelings, I would like to ask you something I would like to have asked myself then.
I know themselves, where they learned to assign the meaning of bad or abnormal to do things.
I'm going to tell you where they did it, they learned about culture.
Do you first want to be <unk>
When we have about five years.
And the truth is that nobody cares about what they were going to do at that age.
It's considered a naive question to make nice answers in the kids like, <unk> or <unk> or <unk> or "I want to be <unk>
It would be <unk> <unk>
This question is done over and over again, and again as we grow in a lot of ways, <unk> <unk> to high school students are asked to ask them at university.
And at some point, what do you want to be <unk>
It's going to be the nice exercise of before what the dream.
Why?
If this question is inspired to the children to dream what they might be, don't inspire to dream with everything you might be.
In fact, it does exactly the other thing, because when someone asks you what you want to be, you can't respond with 20 different things, although adults are probably <unk> and say, "Oh, what's cute, but you can't be <unk> and <unk>
You have to <unk>
This is Dr. Bob <unk>  and he's a <unk> and <unk>
And this Amy <unk> editor in magazine turned into <unk> and <unk> and <unk>
But most of the kids don't hear about people like this.
All you hear is that they're going to have to choose.
But it's more than that.
The notion of life is <unk> in our culture.
It's this idea of fate, or the real call, the idea that every one of us has something that you do for your time in this land, and you have to figure out what that thing is and dedicate your life to it.
But if you're somebody who is not connected in this way?
What if there are lots of different issues that take your curiosity and lots of different things that want to do?
There's no place for somebody like one in that framework.
And so you can feel it alone.
You can feel that it doesn't have a goal.
And feel like there's something wrong with one.
There's nothing wrong with you.
You're a <unk>
A <unk> is someone with a lot of food and creative activities.
It's a <unk>
It could help if you divide in three <unk> multiple <unk> and <unk>
You can also use other terms that would be <unk> the same idea, like <unk> <unk>
For the age of the Renaissance -- the ideal was the ideal who was <unk> in multiple disciplines.
Barbara <unk> refers to us as <unk>
You know, any term you like or give you your own.
It seems like a kind of adapt to a community, we can't agree with one identity.
It's easy to see <unk> like limitation or distress that you must win.
But what I've learned about talking to people and writing about these ideas on my website, is that there are huge strengths in this way.
Here's three superpowers <unk>
One: the synthesis of ideas.
I mean, the combination of two or more fields and the creation of something new in <unk>
<unk> <unk> and Rachel <unk> <unk> his shared interests in 20,000 and travel, and design, and design, when we found <unk>
<unk> is a company who creates jewels <unk>
In <unk> and Rachel came up with this unique idea for his <unk> mix of skills and experiences.
Innovation happens at the intersections.
Hence the new ideas.
And the <unk> with all their background, you can access a lot of these points of <unk>
The second superpower <unk> is learning fast.
When we <unk> it for something, we go to it.
We look at everything we can have in our hands.
We're used to being <unk> by having been a lot of times in the past, and this means that we have fewer fear of testing new things and out of our comfort.
A lot of skills are <unk> to other disciplines, and we bring everything that we have learned to every new area that we can do, so we rarely start from zero.
<unk> <unk> is a <unk> to the whole time and the British author,
As a young pianist. He married an incredible ability to develop muscle memory.
Now, she's the fastest <unk>
Before I become a writer, he was <unk> <unk>
He had to learn the smallest sales mechanics when they began their practices and this ability to write a compelling throws for the editors.
It's hardly a loss of time to go to what you would have to do, even if at the end, you get it.
It's possible to apply that knowledge in a completely different field, in a way that you could not have <unk>
The third superpower <unk> is adaptability. I mean, the ability to turn into anything that you need in a <unk> situation.
<unk> <unk> is sometimes director of videos, others, designer designer.
It's valuable because a good job.
He's even more valuable because it can take diverse <unk> depending on the needs of your clients.
<unk> Company defines adaptability as the most important ability for development, to thrive in the 21st century.
The economic world changes as rapidly and <unk> that are the individuals and organizations that can be able to bring together to meet the needs of the market, which actually <unk>
<unk> of ideas and fast learning, three skills where <unk> are really <unk> and three skills that could be <unk> to reduce their goals.
As a society, we have a great interest in encouraging <unk> to be themselves.
We have complex problems, <unk> right now, and we need creative thinkers to deal with them.
Let's say they are, in your heart <unk>
<unk> of the belly knowing that they wanted to be <unk> <unk>
Don't worry, there's nothing wrong with you.
In fact, some of the best teams make up a specialist and a <unk> <unk>
The specialist can dive into depth and put in ideas and <unk> it provides a breadth of knowledge to the project.
It's a beautiful relationship.
But we should all design lives and careers that we're going to engage with the way we are connected.
And unfortunately, the <unk> in large parts are going to be more than their fellow <unk>
I once said that, if there's one thing that you have to take from this talk, I hope it's this: <unk> with the internal maps, whatever it is.
If you are a heart plan, then <unk> all the media.
That's where you get the best of it.
But for the <unk> in the room, including those who have just to realize being one of them in the last 12 minutes,  I tell them, <unk> with their many passions.
Follow his curiosity.
Let's get the intersections.
We cut our internal wiring into a more real, happy life.
And perhaps most important, we will make the world <unk>
Thank you.
In the year we went to a woman named <unk> they took it to a <unk>
<unk> <unk> and I couldn't remember even most basic details of his life.
His doctor was called <unk>
<unk> I didn't know how to help <unk> but they were <unk> by her, and unfortunately he passed away from <unk>
After his death, he took a <unk> and they found weird plates and <unk> in the brain of a guy who had never seen before.
The most amazing thing.
If you were working on, I would have been living today, we could not give it more help than that <unk> gave him <unk> years ago.
<unk> was Dr. <unk> Alzheimer's.
And <unk> <unk> the first patient in receiving a diagnosis that we now call Alzheimer's.
From <unk> medicine has gotten a lot.
They have discovered antibiotics and vaccines to protect us from <unk> lots of treatments for cancer, <unk> for HIV, <unk> for <unk> and much more.
But slightly progress has been progress on the treatment of Alzheimer's.
I'm part of a team of scientists working to find a cure for Alzheimer's for more than a decade.
So I think about this all the time.
Alzheimer's now affects 40 million worldwide.
But by 2050.
If you wait to live up to 85 years or more, the possibility of Alzheimer's will be almost one of every two.
In other words, there is the likelihood that you have to spend your years <unk> with Alzheimer's or helping care for a friend or a dear Alzheimer's.
Only in the U.S., Alzheimer's care costs 200 billion dollars every year.
One of five dollars of health care is spent on Alzheimer's disease.
Today is the most expensive disease and their costs would increase an increase in five times in 2050, by 2050.
It may surprise you, but Alzheimer's is one of the biggest medical and social challenges of our generation.
But it's been relatively little to <unk>
Today, one of the first causes of death from the entire world, Alzheimer's is the only one that you cannot cure or even slow their development.
We understand less about Alzheimer's than other diseases because we have invested fewer time and money in the research of itself.
The U.S. government spends 10 times more every year in the cancer research that in Alzheimer's despite the fact that it costs us more Alzheimer's and cause a number annual number of deaths like cancer.
The lack of resources is due to a more fundamental cause, the lack of consciousness.
Because this is what time you know, but all the world <unk> Alzheimer's is a disease, and we can <unk>
For most of the last few years, all of all, including scientists, young people with aging.
We think it will be <unk> in a normal and inevitable part of aging.
But there is only a picture of a healthy aged brain, compared to the one of a Alzheimer's patient to see the real physical damage by this disease.
In addition to unleash a severe loss of memory and mental skill, damage to the damage to the human brain, significantly life expectancy is always deadly.
Remember, Dr. Alzheimer's found <unk> and strangers in the brain of <unk> a century ago.
For almost a century, we didn't know a lot about this.
We now know that they're made of proteins.
You can think of a molecule of protein like a piece of paper that folds up as an origami.
There are places in paper that are <unk>
And when it gets folds well, these little dots, they end up inside the inside.
But sometimes things go wrong, and some <unk> dots are outside the outside.
This makes the protein molecules <unk> each other, forming groups that can form big plates and <unk>
That's what we see in the brain of Alzheimer's patients.
We've spent the last 10 years at Cambridge University trying to understand how this <unk> works.
There are a lot of steps, and the identification of what we spend is complex, like <unk> a bomb.
You know, a wire could do anything.
<unk> others can make the bomb bomb.
You have to find the right step that we would do, and then create a drug that does it.
Until recently, in his most part, they have been reduced the wires and waited for the best.
But now there's a diverse group of people, doctors, biologists, <unk> and physicists and mathematician.
And together, we've managed to identify a critical step in the process. Now it's testing a new kind of drugs that blocking specifically this step to stop the disease.
I'm going to show you some of our last results.
No one out of our lab has seen it yet.
Let's look at some videos of what happened when you test these drugs in <unk>
These are <unk> <unk> and you can see that they move with normal.
These worms on the other hand, have molecules of protein that sits on each other inside of them, like with Alzheimer's disease.
And you can see that they're clearly sick.
But when we give our new drugs to these worms at an early stage, then we see it <unk> and live a normal life.
This is just an initial result, but research as this shows that Alzheimer's is a disease that we can understand and cure.
After <unk> years of wait, there's real hope of what can be achieved in the next 10 or 20 years.
But to make that hope, from defeat Alzheimer's, we need help.
It's not about scientists like me, it's about you.
We have to be aware that Alzheimer's is a disease and that if we can see it, we can <unk>
In the case of other diseases, patients and their families have reported more research and <unk> pressure on governments and pharmaceutical industry, about scientists and <unk>
That was essential to move into HIV treatment in the late '80s.
We see that same unit to overcome the cancer.
But Alzheimer's patients often can't talk for themselves.
And their families, the hidden victims of their loved ones and night, they are often too <unk> to get out and advocate for change.
So, really depends on you.
Alzheimer's is not in most cases a genetic disease.
Everyone with a brain runs the peril.
Today, there are 40 million patients like <unk> that cannot create change that need for themselves.
<unk> talking for them, and help demand a cure.
Thank you.
We put this article in the Hudson Love <unk> in January of this year.
In love with somebody, do this.
The article is about a psychological study designed to create romantic love in the laboratory, and my own experience in order to test it myself one night last summer.
So the procedure is quite simple: two strangers were <unk> to get 36 more and more personal questions and then both of you look at the eyes without talking for four minutes.
Here's a couple of questions.
Number one: If you could wake up tomorrow with an quality or skill, what would that be?
Number one: When was the last time you were going to go to another person?
And <unk>
We <unk> these are more and more personal ones.
Number <unk> <unk> really <unk> me to your partner what you like to him or her -- I know very honest this time, and I gave things that you don't have ever met.
When I came across this studio a few years ago, a really detail was really called the attention, the gadget that two of the participants had married six months later, and invited all the lab to <unk>
So, it was <unk> about this process of making romantic love, but of course, it was <unk>
And when I had the occasion of proving this studio, with someone who I knew not particularly very well, I didn't wait for it."
But I thought it was a good story, and  And I thought it was a good story, so I sent it to the spine for a few months later.
That was published in January, and now it's already <unk> so I guess some of you probably ask, keep them together.
And the reason I think you challenge this is because they've done this question for me and over the last seven months.
And this question is just what I want to talk about today.
But let's go back to it.
One week before I was published the paper was so nervous.
He had been working on a romantic book in the last few years, so I had <unk> to write about my experience in romantic love in my blog.
But a blog blog can get to a few hundred views as a lot, and those were usually just from my Facebook friends and imagined that my article in the New York Times would probably be a few thousand views.
And that came up with a good burden of attention in a relatively new relationship.
But I had no idea.
The paper was published on a Friday at night, and already the Saturday, this happened in the traffic of my blog.
And Sunday, I had called the "Today Show and "Good <unk> <unk>
In one month, the paper received over eight million pages, and I was, by saying something, little prepared for this kind of attention.
One thing is to encourage confidence to be writing with fear of <unk> but another thing is to find out that life <unk> of an international news has been international news -- and that people in the world are really interested in the state of your new relationship.
And when people call it or <unk> what they did every day for weeks, they always did the same question: still follow together?
In fact, when I was preparing this talk, I made a quick search for my email with the phrase, <unk> still <unk>
And several messages came up immediately.
They were from students and journalists and strange <unk> like this.
They interviewed me on radio and <unk>
But yet, I gave a talk, and a woman screamed at the stage, "Hey, <unk> where your <unk> is.
And immediately I got a red <unk>
I understand that this is part of the deal.
If you write about your relationship in an international newspaper, you should wait for people to feel comfortable by asking about it.
But I was not prepared for the wingspan of the answer.
The 36 questions seemed to have <unk> life.
In fact, the New York Times published a <unk> article for San <unk> who included the experiences of readers to test the studio in them with different degrees of success.
So, my first lead to all this attention was to be very confined to my own relationship.
I said not to every request that we both did a public emergence together.
<unk> TV interviews, and <unk> the requests of us two.
I think it was afraid of becoming the icons <unk> of the <unk> process, a range for which I didn't feel at all <unk>
And I understand that people didn't want to know only if the study worked, they wanted to know if you really miss it, I mean, if it was able to produce love, <unk> not just a adventure, but love, love <unk>
But this was a question I didn't feel able to answer.
My relationship was just a few months, and I felt, mostly said the wrong question.
How do you know if you go together or not, and also <unk>
If the answer was no, I would make the experience of doing these 36 questions less interesting?
Dr. Arthur <unk> wrote first about these questions in this particular studio in 1997. And there, the goal of the researcher was not producing romantic love.
Instead of that, I was looking at interpersonal view, between students in college, using what was <unk> called <unk> <unk> and <unk>
Sounds romantic, isn't it?
But the studio did.
The participants had felt closer to do several <unk> studies, they also used economic protocol -- <unk> <unk> as a quick way of creating trust and interaction between strangers.
They've been used between members of the police and the community, and they have used it among people from the opposite political ideologies of themselves.
The original version of the story, which I proved last summer, which combined questions with four minutes of visual contact, was cited in this article but unfortunately never published.
A few months ago, I was giving a talk on a little <unk> college, and then a student came up to me and told me with <unk> <unk> the studio and didn't work.
He seemed <unk> for that.
And I said, you want to say that you're going to give you the person who you do it.
Well, he made a pause.
I think she just wants us to be friends.
And I said, but it became better friends?
<unk> that they were able to get better to get better after proving the research set.
<unk>
So, <unk> I said.
Yet, I don't think that was the answer that he was looking for.
In fact, I don't think it's the answer that none of you are looking for when it's love.
I came across the studio for the first time when I was 29, and I was going through a really hard separation to it.
He had had that relationship since I was 20, what I was in practically all my adult life, and he was my first real love, and I had no idea how or if I could live without it.
So I went to science.
I did everything that I could find on the science of romantic love, and I expected that that could kind of get the heart.
I don't know if I realized this at the time, I thought I just did for the book that I wrote to do, but in retrospect, it seems really <unk>
I thought that if I gave myself the knowledge of the romantic love, I would never have to feel so bad and I used to get it back then.
And all this knowledge has been useful in one way or another.
I'm more patient with love.
I have more confidence to demand what I went on.
But I can also see me more clearly, and I can realize that what I'm looking for is sometimes more than you can reasonably demand me to me.
What I'm looking for of love is a secure -- not just to be <unk> today, and it's going to be <unk> in the person that I love being <unk>
It may be that this is the guarantee that people wondered when they wanted to know whether we were still together.
The story told us about 36 questions is that there might be a shortcut to <unk>
There might be a way to mitigate a way to mitigate some of the <unk> risk -- and this is a very important story, because in love makes us feel beautifully, but it's also terrifying.
But I think that when it comes to love, we're really willing to accept the short version of history.
The version of the story that asks, still follow together?
And his content with an answer to an answer or No.
So more than a question, let's make it more difficult questions like, how do you decide who deserves your love, and who doesn't?
How do you remain in love when things are <unk> and how to know when to cut and <unk>
How do you live with uncertainty that inevitably has a relationship? Or even more, how do you live with the question of your <unk>
I don't know necessarily the answers to these questions, but I think they're a good start to have a more <unk> conversation about what it means to love anybody.
So if you want the short version of the history of my relationship, is <unk> a year ago, a known and I could apply a study designed to create romantic love, we are still <unk> and I'm very angry.
But in love with not the same thing to remain <unk>
<unk> is the easy.
So at the end of my article. Love didn't happen.
<unk> fell in love because we took the choice to be.
And I shudder to read it now, not because it's not true, but because at the time, I had not thought about what that choice was about.
I didn't consider how we would have both to take that decision, and how much it will have to keep doing that choice without knowing before he was always asking me or not.
I want it to be enough to have done and responded 36 questions, I have chosen to love somebody as generous, kind of fun and have expressed that choice in the largest day in the United States.
But what I've done, instead is turning my relationship into the kind of myth where I don't really think of truth.
And what we <unk> and what I might spend my life looking for is that that myth is true.
I want the happy to implicit in the title of my paper -- which is, by the way, the only part of the paper that I didn't really write about.
But what I have in change is the opportunity to love somebody, and the hope that he also will love me, and it's scary, but that's the deal with love.
Thank you.
I was raised for a little pet in full mountain, and in some way I got a <unk> of the forest forest.
New York City for a while.  One thing that really affected me but more details to me.
I'm going to start when I was eight years old.
He took a box of wood, and <unk> a dollar, a dollar, a pen and a fork and a fork in her somewhere in Colorado.
And I thought that some of the strange <unk> or some aliens would find this box about 500 years later and <unk> how our species <unk> for example how you eat <unk>
I had no idea.
Anyway, it has fun because here I am, 30 years later, and I'm still doing boxes.
At a moment he was in <unk> <unk> I like to go from <unk> and make <unk> and all those things <unk> and I was doing a <unk> for my mother.
And I took a dictionary and I took all the pages and I made a kind of <unk> <unk> I was Agnes <unk> and a bee left.
Well, my mother is afraid of bees, and it's <unk> to them, so I added more salt on the canvas, thinking that he could <unk>
Instead, it happened the opposite: somehow it seemed to rise to size, as if we were to make the text with a <unk>
So I did I built more boxes.
And this time, I started to add some electronic elements, you know, some weird bottles of them that I was finding on the street, everything I could find, because I was looking for things all my life, trying to <unk> and tell stories about these objects.
So I got to draw around the objects, and I realized that God can draw in space.
I can flow in <unk> drawing as well as a little bit of a <unk>
And I took objects and created my objects and created my own taxonomy of specimens <unk>
First of all, <unk> that you can get a idea.
And then I did some insects and very strange creatures.
It was really fun to draw in the layers of <unk>
And it was great, because I started building exhibitions and those things, and I was earning some money, to take my girlfriend for dinner, for example, going to <unk>
It was great, man.
At some point, I became interested in the human shape of the human form, sculptures of natural size with drawings of human beings inside the layers.
It was great, except for one thing:
I didn't know what to do, because the resin was going to kill.
And I went to bed every night thinking about it.
So I tried to use glass.
I started drawing on the layers of glass, similar to the drawing on a window, and another window, and another window, and I had all these windows together that make a three-dimensional composition of it.
And this really worked, and so I could stop using <unk>
So I did this for years, and my work with something very big, that I call <unk>
For the <unk> I was inspired by the great measure in "The <unk> <unk> <unk> which is a painting in the Museum of <unk> in Spain.

Well, it's a fantastic picture.
They say it's a little bit ahead of their time.
Well, the <unk> <unk> this piece.
It weighs 11 pounds.
5.5 meters long.
It's <unk> for what is 10 meters of composition.
It's kind of weird.
Well, that's the source of the blood.
On the left, it's Jesus and <unk>
There's a cave where all of these creatures with animal heads travel between two worlds.
They go from the world of representation, with this <unk> mesh where it <unk>
This is where creatures with the heads of animals are headed to <unk> lists for suicide <unk>
The ocean is comprised of thousands of elements.
This is a bird god strapped to a <unk>
Billy Graham is in the <unk> The <unk> -- the <unk> platform.
Anyway, also a kind of <unk>
It's coming out of the ocean, and it spits out oil in a hand while the other hand is coming out.
Their hands are like <unk> and it seems to be <unk> that holds the Earth and the cosmos in balance.
So it's a aspect of <unk>
It's a little bit of narrative.
That's the hand in which you are."
And then, when you go on the other hand, it has a <unk> like a bird's bird, and it spits out clouds of this <unk>
It also has a half feet long of a long feet of <unk> <unk>
Anyway, his tail <unk> a <unk> on a <unk>
I don't know why it happened.
Things that come you you know.
His tail ends up in a <unk> eyeball made from terrorist cards, 1986.
They have <unk>
They were done in the 1980s, as if they were baseball cards of the terrorists.
It takes me to my last project.  This brings me to my last project.
I'm in the middle of two <unk> One is called <unk>
This is a six-year-old project to make 100 of these human beings.
Each one is a archive of our culture, through media and material to be <unk> dictionaries.
But each one acts as a kind of archive in a form of human being, and travel in groups of 20, four or 12 at the same time.
They're like cells, they come together, they <unk>
And you can walk between them. It's a few years old.
Each one is basically a <unk> of microscope that weighs 1.3 thousand pounds with a human <unk>
This has a little cave on the chest.
That's the <unk> there's the chest, you can get it off the door.
I'm going to play you for the rest of the body, there's a waterfall that comes out of the chest, and that puts your penis or <unk> or whatever it is, a kind of <unk> thing.
It's a quick check of these works because I can't afford it for a long time.
We have layers, you can see.
This is a <unk> body for half.
This has two heads and it's communicating between the two.
There are some pills that go out and enter the head of this strange statue out.
There's a little little scene forest inside the <unk>
Can you <unk>
Anyway, this talk is about these <unk> just like the boxes that we live in.
We're in a box, the solar system is a box.
This brings me to my last box.
It's a brick box called <unk> <unk>
In this box there is a physicist -- a neuroscientist, a painter, a painter, a musician, a <unk> a <unk> a museum, a museum, an editorial arm.
We <unk> the box and all the people in inside each other as particles.
And I think that's the way we change the world.
When you get <unk> who is and the box that is living in.
And together we came to realize that we're all together in this, that this delusion that we are different -- these concepts of countries, of religion, doesn't work.
We're all very facts about the same stuff and in the same box.
And if we don't start exchanging those things with sweetness and <unk> we're all going to die very soon.
Thank you very much.
What do you do when they hurts your head?
They take a <unk>
But for this pill to have a pill effect on your pain, the bowels of and other organs.
I'll take a pill is the most effective system and you can take a pill for any drug <unk> in the body.
The <unk> though, is that by <unk> any drug <unk>
And this is a big problem, especially in HIV patients.
When they take drugs that are <unk> these are <unk> to decrease the amount of virus in the blood, and increase the heart of cells.
But they are also known for their <unk> side effects in its most negative, because in the time that it takes you to get to the current -- you get <unk> and worse even for the time that takes you to get to its destiny, which is where it's more importantly, at the repository of HIV.
These are regions of the body like the <unk> the nervous system, the lungs, where the virus is <unk> and it doesn't easily go into the blood stream of patients that are <unk> to the regular therapy of HIV/AIDS.
Yet, after the disruption of treatment, the virus can wake and infect new bacterial cells.
This is the great problem with HIV treatment with the current drugs that is a treatment for life run by its own.
One day, I sat down and I thought, let's get the treatment directly to the warehouse of the virus, without the risk of <unk>
As a scientist expert in <unk> the answer was in front of me, <unk> of course.
If you use it in <unk> for care of wounds and surgery.
In fact, we're using laser pulses to open or drill up extremely small holes, which open up and shut up almost immediately the cells infected with HIV to introduce drugs.
The best you ask, "How did that happen?"
We sent a little powerful beam of laser beam on the cellular membrane in the cellular membrane for HIV while these cells are embedded in a liquid that has the drug.
The laser goes through the cell, whereas the cell absorb the drug in the question of microseconds.
Before you even notice, the hole is <unk> immediately.
We're testing this technology in vitro or <unk> <unk> but the goal is to bring this technology into the human body, apply to the human body.
"What is that <unk> you can ask.
Well, the answer is, through a device of three heads.
With the first brain, which is our laser, we'll make a <unk> on the site of the infection.
The second brain, which is a camera, and it's running at the site of the infection.
Finally, the third head -- a <unk> that distributes the pollution that releases it directly at the site of infection, while the laser is used again to keep open cells.
Well, this doesn't seem a lot of time.
But one day, if you succeed, this technology can lead to the total eradication of HIV.
Yeah. A cure for HIV.
This is the dream of every single researcher of <unk> in our case, a laser treatment.
Thank you.
In the last decade, I've been studying groups of armed groups who have been inspired as terrorists, insurgents or <unk>
They get what these groups do when they're not <unk>
My goal is to understand better to these agents of violence, and studying ways of encouraging the transition from violent involvement at confrontation not violent.
I do work work in the world of politics and in the library.
Understanding these groups is key to solve almost every conflict in course, because the war has changed.
It used to be a dispute between states.
Not anymore.
Now it's a conflict between states and actors.
For example, of the <unk> golf peace deals between 1975.
So we need to understand these <unk> we even have to <unk> or <unk> in any kind of successful conflict.
But how do you do that?
We have to know what motivates these organizations.
We know very well the reasons why they do, how do they do, but no one sees what they do when they don't exist.
The armed struggle and political policies have been <unk>
It's all part of the same organization.
We can't understand these groups, not much less <unk> without a global vision.
<unk> groups are complex organizations.
For example, <unk> <unk> known for their violent trial against Israel.
From its creation in the 1980s -- <unk> also has set a political game, a network of social services and a military device.
Similarly, Palestinian <unk> known for their suicide suicide attacks of Israel, also runs the <unk> in Gaza since 2007.
So these groups make more than simply shooting.
They're multitasking
<unk> a complex <unk> <unk> stations, radio stations, cable channels of television, web websites and strategies in social networks.
And here are the magazine <unk> in English and published to <unk>
<unk> groups are also investing in a complex fundraising fundraising in <unk> but through business <unk> for example, building companies.
These activities are true.
They allow these groups to increase their <unk> increase their funding, to recruit them better and build their brand.
<unk> groups also do something else: they create stronger with their population by investing in social services.
They build schools -- running hospitals, they put in commercial training programs or <unk>
<unk> offers all these services and more.
<unk> groups also try to conquer the population to offering something that the state not and security and protection.
The rise of the Taliban in an Afghanistan fell through the war or even the <unk> <unk> can be able to understand the efforts of these groups to provide safety.
Unfortunately in these cases, security has an effective price price for the population.
But in general, providing social services that means filling an empty gap.
For example, the victory electoral of 2006, Palestinian hackers cannot recognize the social work of the group.
It's a really complex scenario, even in the West, when we look at the groups, we just think about the violent side.
But that's not enough to understand the strengths of these groups, strategy or long-term vision.
These groups are <unk>
<unk> because they fill themselves gaps by the government, and they emerge as groups and political groups, participate in the violent struggle and give governance.
And the more complex and the more sophisticated ones are these organizations, fewer we can <unk> as something contrary to a state.
How do you call a group like <unk>
They put a part of an territory, running all of your <unk> pick out the trash system running the <unk> system.
It's a state? It's a <unk> group.
Or perhaps something else, something new and different.
And what is it <unk>
The lines are <unk>
We live in a world of states, and no state and hybrids and the more weak ones are states, like in the Middle East, more <unk> and fill that gap the actors we don't have government.
This is important for governments, because to counter these groups will have to invest more in the military tools.
<unk> that government has to be at the center of any sustainable approach.
This is very important to establish and putting the peace.
If we understand the groups better understand how much better incentives to encourage the transition from violence.
In this new dispute between states and actors and actors <unk> the military power can win some battles, but we won't give us for peace and stability.
In order to achieve these goals we need long-term investments to fill up that security gap.
Thank you.
I'm a failure as a woman and as a feminist.
My opinions about gender equality are <unk> but I'm afraid to accept the label of <unk> would be unfair for the <unk>
I'm a neuroscientist, but pretty bad.
And therefore I would tell myself as a bad feminist.
Or, at least, I wrote a paper, and a book called "The <unk> and then in the interviews, people started to call it <unk> <unk>
So what started as a personal joke meant to me and a <unk> <unk> has become something larger.
Let me take a step back.
When I was a young woman, especially in my youth and at the age of 20 years, I had weird ideas about <unk> these women <unk> <unk> with men and <unk> who are being bad.
Today, I see how women are treated around the world and anger, in particular it seems a perfectly reasonable answer.
But at the time, I was worried about the tone that I was using people to the <unk> that might be a feminist.
Being labeled as a feminist was a <unk> a taboo and nasty.
It was <unk> as a woman who doesn't follow the rules -- who begs too much, with high self-worth and dare to believe that it's equal or superior to a man.
No one wants to be that woman <unk> until it realizes that it's actually that woman, and he can't imagine being another person.
With time, as I was growing, I started accepting that I am, in fact, <unk> and also, proud of it.
For me, certain claims, are <unk> women are equal to men.
It would take the same wages for the same job.
We have a right to travel around the world as <unk> <unk> or violence.
We have a right to use it easy and accessible the contraceptives and the service services.
We have the right to decide about our bodies, no need for <unk> or doctrines to <unk>
We have the right to respect.
There's more.
When you talk about the needs of women, you have to have to count our other <unk>
We're not just women.
We are people with a different body, expression of gender gender, religion and our <unk> and skills and so much more.
We have to have these differences in account for these differences and how we care about the same way that matters what we have in common.
Without this kind of <unk> our feminism is nothing.
For me, these truths are <unk> but to be clear: I'm a mess.
I'm full of contradictions.
There's a lot of things that make me a bad feminist.
I have another confession.
When I lead to work, I hear rap music <unk>
Although the letter degrades up to women and <unk> and the classic <unk> <unk> of the yin <unk> is amazing.
Do you actually get your t-shirt <unk>
<unk> <unk> <unk> until you get <unk> <unk>
Think about it.
<unk> poetry isn't it?
I am completely <unk> by my musical opinion.
I believe it in the work of man, which is all that I don't want to do, <unk> --  all the <unk> <unk> but also killing insects, the trash collection and the maintenance of <unk>
I don't want to have anything to do with that.
The pink is my favorite color.
We call it from fashion fashion and good things.
I can see "The <unk> and the <unk> <unk> and I have erotic fantasies of the fairy tales that come true.
Some of my crimes are more <unk>
If a woman wants to adopt the name of his husband, it's his choice, and I'm not who to be <unk>
If a woman decides to stay home to raise his kids, I accepted that choice, too.
The problem is not that it becomes economically vulnerable through this same choice, the problem is that our society is <unk> in a way that makes women financially vulnerable when they are.
<unk> this problem.
<unk> the conventional feminism that has bypassed or <unk> historically the needs of color, the <unk> and <unk> <unk> and <unk> in favor of white women, <unk> <unk>
Listen, if that's good feminism is a very bad feminist story.
It also happens to the following: It's a lot of pressure.
We have this tendency to <unk> <unk> <unk>
We hope it will be <unk>
When we get older, <unk> with a lot of taste from the same <unk> where the <unk>
As I said, I'm a <unk> I already consider myself from that <unk> before I try to get there.
<unk> women, particularly innovative and leaders leaders are afraid to be tagged as <unk>
They are afraid to stand up and say, "Yes, I am <unk> fear of what that math means is not going to be able to do with the little realistic.
Take for example, or like I call it <unk>
Over the last few years is a <unk> feminist thing.
In the <unk> Music of 2014, in <unk> <unk> in front of the word <unk> from three feet tall.
It was a show of <unk> looking at this pop star embracing feminism and making women and young men who will be feminist is something to be proud of.
<unk> the time, critical critics started never-ending debates whether it was or not exactly a feminist.
It was going to look at their feminism, rather than just believing the word of an adult and <unk>
<unk> perfection is <unk> because we're still fighting a lot, we want a lot, we need so much <unk>
We go through a lot beyond the sensible criticism and <unk> to <unk> the feminism of any woman, <unk> until there is nothing left.
We don't need to do that.
The bad reason or a feminism is <unk> is the point of <unk>
But what happens next?
We went from recognizing our <unk> to give it a little bit more <unk>
If I listen to music, I am creating a demand for artists that would be more than happy to give a <unk> supply.
These artists will not change their way to talk about women in their songs until we overestimate change effectively their profit.
It's certainly hard.
Why has his music to be so <unk>
It's hard to choose something better and so easy to justify a better choice.
But when bad decisions will justify this makes it more difficult for women to achieve gender equality, gender that we all deserve and is our responsibility.
I think about my <unk> three and four years.
They are two <unk> <unk> <unk> and bright and too brave. I want you to grow up in a world.
where they were scared by the strong creatures that they are.
I think of them, all of a sudden, the best option will be <unk> as something much more easy to do.
We all can make better decisions.
We can change the channel when a TV program is about sexual violence against women, like sports, <unk> <unk>
We can change the radio <unk> when we hear songs that treat women like anything.
We can spend our money to go to the cinema in another part when films are not treat women more than as <unk> objects.
We can stop supporting the professional sports where athletes treat their companions like <unk>
In any case, the men, especially white men can say, "No, I'm not going to publish your magazine, participating in their magazine, or work with you, until it doesn't involve a number of women, so much to participate as to make decisions.
I'm not going to work with you until your <unk> or your organization is more <unk> with a wider range of people."
Those of us who are <unk> but they will be able to participate in this kind of projects, we can also be able to get them to be including even more as we are <unk> to overcome the barriers to the <unk>
We are not a <unk> without these efforts, without knowing these <unk> our achievements will mean very little.
We can make these little kinds of bravery and hope that our decisions will get to the top, to the people in the power principals and producers and music, <unk> the <unk> the people who can make great decisions, more courageous, to create a durable and significant change.
We can also say with bravery our question -- well, bad, or any <unk>
The last line of my book <unk> <unk> says, <unk> will be a bad feminist not to be <unk>
This is true because of a lot of reasons, but I say, most of all, because I took my voice to me, and feminism helped me <unk>
There was one incident.
I call it a specific thing to deal with what happened.
A few guys <unk> when I was very young, and I didn't know that kids can do this to a girl.
I was treated like it was nothing.
I started to believe that it was nothing.
<unk> my voice, and after all I didn't get to believe that I could say something that might matter.
But -- I was writing.
And I went back to <unk>
It was a more strong version of myself.
I read the words of those women who could understand a story like mine, and of the women who looked like me and they understood what meant to live in this world if you have the brown skin.
I read the words of the women who showed me that it was nothing.
I learned how to write like them, and then I learned to write like myself.
I found my voice again, and I started to believe that my voice is powerful beyond what you can measure.
Through the writing, I also discovered that if I was a little brave one, another woman could hear me and see that none of us is nothing that the world is about telling us that we are.
In one hand, I have the power to achieve anything.
And in the other, I hold the real reality that I'm just a woman.
I'm a bad lady. I'm a good woman, I'm trying to improve my way to think, what I do, without leaving everything that makes me human life.
I hope we could all do the same.
I hope we could all be a little bit courageous, when you need a little bit of such a <unk>
Just after Christmas last year, <unk> children in California, had been <unk> by having visited <unk> or being exposed to someone who had been there.
The virus went through the border of Canada, <unk> over 100 children in <unk>
One of the <unk> things from this outbreak is that <unk> which can be terrible for a child with a immune system, is one of the most easily <unk> diseases in the world.
There is an effective vaccine against this for more than half a century -- but many of the children involved in the nuclear outbreak had not been vaccinated because their parents were afraid of something supposedly <unk> autism.
But a moment, it was not the article that sparked the optimism of autism and the <unk> vaccines and made by being a <unk> fraud by the British Medical School.
They don't believe most intelligent scientists that the theory of vaccines cause autism is a <unk>
I think most of you know it -- but millions of parents around the world are still <unk> that vaccines are in danger to their children of having autism.
Why?
Here's why.
This is a graph of the estimates of autism in time.
For most of the 20th century, autism was considered a very bizarre disease.
The few psychologists and pediatricians who had heard about it, they believed to develop every professional life without looking at one case.
For decades, the prevalence estimates continued to only three or four children for every <unk>
But then, in the 1990s, the numbers started <unk>
Unlike fundraising.
What's going on?
If you are not vaccines, what is it?
If you ask people at the Center for Disease Control Center at Atlanta, what is going on, they tend to based on phrases like <unk> diagnostic diagnosis and a better <unk> to explain these numbers <unk>
But that kind of language don't <unk> a lot of the fears of a young mother who is looking for the face of his two-year-old son.
If the criteria of the diagnosis had to be, why were they so reduced in the beginning?
Why were the cases of autism so hard to find before the <unk>
Five years ago, I decided to find the answers to these questions.
I learned that what happened is less to do with slow progress and <unk> of the science than the <unk> of storytelling.
For most of the 20th century, the doctors told us a story about what autism is and what was discovered, but that story turned out to be fake, and the consequences of the same is having a devastating impact on global health care.
There was a second most accurate story of autism than had lost and forgotten in the dark corners of the clinical literature.
This second story tells us all about how we got here and where we have to go.
The first story begins with a child psychiatrist Leo <unk> at the Johns Hopkins Hospital in <unk> <unk> published an article that describes 11 young patients who seemed to be <unk> and the private worlds and <unk> people around their own parents.
They could afford for fun for hours, shaking your hands in front of his faces, but they were prey to <unk> as when he didn't put his favorite toy in his usual place without knowing them.
On the basis of the treaties in their clinic, <unk> <unk> that autism is really weird.
For the 1950s.
This is actually not surprisingly, because the criteria of <unk> for the diagnostic diagnosis were really <unk>
For example, <unk> to give that diagnosis with <unk> but we now know that epilepsy, is very common in autism.
Once he was <unk> that he had become nine of every 10 children to his office to be autistic without giving them a diagnosis of autism.
<unk> was a smart, but part of his theories were not <unk>
<unk> autism as a form of childhood <unk> caused by cold parents, and <unk>
These kids, he said, have kept on a refrigerator <unk>
At the same time, though, <unk> noticed that some of their young patients had special skills that we cluster in certain areas like music, mathematics and memory.
One of the kids in their clinic could distinguish between 18 <unk> before I turned the two years.
When his mother put one of his favorite records -- he said, <unk>
But <unk> had a bad view of these skills, claiming things like the kids were simply <unk> what they had heard of their parents were desperate to win their approval out.
As a result, autism became a source of shame for families, and two generations of autistic children were sent to institutions for their own well, becoming invisible to the world in general.
Surprisingly, it was not until the 1970s, the researchers started testing the theory of <unk> that autism was weird.
<unk> <unk> psychologist, cognitive psychologist, thought that the theory of mothers <unk> <unk> was pretty stupid.
She and his husband John were <unk> and <unk> and they had a deep autistic daughter named <unk>
<unk> and John knew how hard it was to raise a girl who was no service, no support, no special education, and no access to other resources without a diagnosis.
In order to defend the National Foreign Service, they needed more resources for autistic children, and their families, <unk> and their colleague Judith Gould decided to do something that should have done 30 years before.
They launched a study of autism in the general population.
We took a suburb of London called <unk> to try to find the autistic children in the community.
What you saw was clear that the model of <unk> was too limited, because the fact of autism was much more <unk> and diverse diverse.
Some kids could not speak at all, while others were <unk> in their fascination for astrophysics, or the <unk> of <unk>
Otherwise these kids didn't fit in beautiful frames and <unk> as they said, and they saw a lot of them, much more than the <unk> model of <unk> would have predicted.
Initially, they were lost to try to make sense of their data.
How no one had ever noticed these kids before?
But then <unk> I found a reference to a paper that was published in German in <unk> the next year of <unk> and then <unk> buried under the ashes of a terrible time nobody wanted to remember.
<unk> knew about this article of competition, but avoided <unk> on his own work.
There was not even a translation to the English -- but luckily, the husband of <unk> was speaking German, and he <unk> it for her.
The document offers an alternative story of autism.
His author was a man named Hans <unk> who was running an integrated clinic with a school in Vienna, in the 1930s.
The ideas of Asperger's for teaching kids are <unk> even for contemporary standards.
The morning in his clinic began with music classes.
Instead of blaming the parents of causing autism, Asperger's described as young people for life that were required for <unk> and <unk> spaces for the course of life.
Instead of treating kids in their clinic as patients, Asperger's he called them their little teachers, and he started to help in the development of methods that were especially right for them.
<unk> Asperger's saw autism as a diverse continuum that led an amazing variety of adventure and disabilities.
He believed that autism and autistic traits were common and they've always been, looking at the aspects of this continuum in <unk> culture like the awkward and awkward scientist, and Professor <unk>
He was beyond even to say, for success in science and art, a little bit of autism is essential.
<unk> and Judith found out that <unk> was wrong that autism was <unk> as well as the parents were <unk>
Over the next few years, worked in silence with the American Association of <unk> to extend the criteria of the diagnosis that reflect the diversity of what they called <unk> <unk>
In the late 1980s and early 1990s, their changes came into <unk> by the limited model of <unk> by a broad and <unk>
These changes were not on the <unk>
<unk> when <unk> and Judith worked in the <unk> to reform these <unk> people around the world see an autistic adult for the first time.
Before it came out <unk> <unk> in 1988, just a small circle, <unk> by experts knew what the autism, but after <unk> performance of <unk> <unk> as <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> and fathers all over the world knew what autism.
At the same time, the first clinical trials were introduced to actually diagnose autism.
I didn't have a connection with that little circle of experts to achieve a diagnosis for his son.
The combination of <unk> <unk> the changes in the criteria and the introduction of these tests created a network, a perfect storm of autism.
The number of diagnostics began to <unk> the same as predicted <unk> and <unk> in fact so they were going out to make people with autism and their families finally <unk> the support and services that are <unk>
So Andrew <unk> came to blame vaccines for the increase in the diagnostics. A simple, powerful story, and <unk> Jewish history as bad as the <unk> theory that autism was <unk>
If the current estimate of the heart estimate of preventing one of every 68 children in the United States are in the spectrum, the autistic are one of the largest largest groups in the world.
In the last few years, nuclear people have joined the Internet to reject the idea that they are the puzzles to solve by the new medical advances -- the term <unk> to celebrate the varieties of human cognition.
One way to understand <unk> is to think in terms of human operating systems.
The fact that a computer doesn't work with no Windows -- it doesn't mean it's <unk>
According to the <unk> standards -- the normal human brain is easily <unk> social, social <unk> and suffer from a deficit deficit to detail.
Certainly autistic people have difficulty living in a world not built for them.
70 years later, we're still getting to <unk> who believed that <unk> for the most autism aspects of autism are in the understanding of the teachers, employers with capability, communities in the potential of their children.
A autistic woman named <unk> <unk> once said, "We want all the hands in cover to <unk> the boat of <unk>
As we went to an uncertain future, we need all the forms of human intelligence on the planet to deal with the challenges we face as a society.
We can't afford to waste a brain.
Thank you.
