You know what I do is to write for kids, and in fact, I'm probably the author for children -- more read in the U.S.
And I always tell people that I don't want to look like a scientist.
I can <unk> as a farmer, or with clothing -- and no one has chosen a farmer.
I'm here today to talk to you about circles and <unk>
And you know an epiphany is generally something that came somewhere else.
You just have to go back to the apple to see it as a <unk>
That's the painting of a circle.
A friend of mine did that -- Richard <unk>
It's the kind of complicated circle that I'm going to talk to you.
My circle started in the middle of the years in the middle school, in <unk> Ohio where I was the weird thing.
When I <unk> to bleed every week in the bathroom, until a teacher saved my life.
She saved my life to let me get into the bathroom room in the room.
I was doing it in secret,
For three years.
And I had to go from the city.
He had a thumb, and 85 dollars, and I ended up in San Francisco, California -- I found a lover -- and in the years, I felt the need to start working in organizations fighting against AIDS.
About three or four years ago, half the night I got a phone call from that <unk> the <unk> lady who said, "I need to see you.
I'm <unk> that adults never come to us.
You could give it to Ohio and please bring that man to know you've found.
And I have to tell you that I have <unk> cancer, and I would like you to stand up with this, please."
Well, the next day we were in <unk>
We went to see, we were <unk> and we realized that she needed to be <unk>
We found a place, <unk> and <unk> and <unk> from his family, because it was necessary, because it was necessary, and we found it.
It's something we knew how to do.
And as the woman who wanted to <unk> as adult came to <unk> it became a box of ashes and was put in my hands.
And what happened was that the circle had been closed, had become a circle -- and that epiphany that I told you about it was done in itself.
<unk> is that death is part of life.
She saved my life, my partner and I save her from her.
And you know that part of life needs everything that the rest of life.
It needs truth and beauty, and I'm very happy that today, I talked a lot about this.
It also needs -- it needs dignity, love and pleasure. And it's our work to provide those things.
Thank you.
As an artist, the connection is very important to me.
Through my work, I'm trying to express that humans are not separated from nature and everything is interconnected.
I was for the first time to Antarctica almost 10 years ago, and I saw my first <unk>
I was <unk>
My heart can quickly, I was <unk> trying to understand what was in front of me.
I will hold them to me around the water around 60 feet -- and I couldn't think that it was about a <unk> on another <unk> on another <unk> year after year.
<unk> are born when you come up with the glaciers or break the ice barriers there.
Every iceberg has its own individual personality.
They have a different way of interacting with their environment and their experiences.
Some people refuse to give up and hold up to the end, while others can't afford them more and <unk> in a <unk> passion.
It's easy to think, looking at a <unk> who are isolated apart and themselves, as much as we see ourselves as humans.
But reality is the opposite.
As a <unk> I'm breathing the <unk> atmosphere.
As a iceberg, a iceberg, releases fresh water in minerals that feeds a lot of forms of life.
I come up to photograph these <unk> as if it was about the portraits of my ancestors, knowing that in these unique moments there are that way and they will not exist in that way again.
It's not the death when it's <unk> it's not an end, but a continuation of its way through the cycle of life.
Part of the <unk> ice that I <unk> is very <unk> has a couple of years old.
And another part of the ice has over 100,000 years.
The last couple of pictures I'd like to show you is an iceberg that I photographed at <unk> Greenland.
It's a bit frequent to actually get to witness a <unk>
Here they go.
You can see the left a little boat.
It's about five meters.
And I'd like you to pay attention to the shape of the iceberg, and your line of <unk>
You can see here, it starts to <unk> the ship has moved to the other side and the man is standing there.
This is a <unk> economy.
<unk> water about 120 feet or 40 meters.
This video is in real time.
And so we <unk> the iceberg shows a different side of his personality.
Thank you.
I want you to imagine two couples in 1979, the same day, exactly at the same time, every single one.
So, two couples every one with a baby.
I don't want it to be too much in the details of conception, because if they stop thinking about the conception of yes, they're not going to pay attention.
Let's think about that for a moment.
And on this stage I want you to imagine that, in one case, the sperm comes together to the X chromosome from the <unk>
And in the other case, the X chromosome out of sperm is joined up to the X chromosome from the <unk>
Both <unk> and it starts life.
We'll go back to talk about them later.
In my ocean activity -- I would take two roles.
In one of my <unk> work with the story of anatomy.
I am <unk> by training and what I study in this case is the way people get the anatomy -- that is, of human bodies and <unk> how they have considered body fluid the idea of <unk> what have you thought about the body.
The other role in my work is an activist, as a <unk> of patients or, as I say sometimes, <unk> <unk> of people who are medical patients.
In this case, I've worked with people whose physical features challenge social norms.
I've been working on, for example, with identical twins two people inside the same body.
I've worked with people with <unk> people much lower than the average.
And I've been working with a lot of cases of people who have sex <unk> individuals whose physical typology doesn't fit in male and male feminine <unk>
In general, we can <unk> <unk>
The <unk> <unk>
I'm going to give you some examples in ways of having a sex that is not going to be <unk> in the average forms of male or female.
For example, there's the case of the individual with <unk> <unk> whose <unk> gene from the chromosome -- and he says to the <unk> that we all have in life that we all have in <unk> life that will become <unk>
And then, in <unk> life, the testicles are producing testosterone.
But because this guy has no aware of testosterone, the body doesn't react to the same.
It's <unk> syndrome.
So, there are high levels of testosterone but <unk>
As a result, the body develops following a course typically female course.
When we <unk> the baby looks like a child.
It's a little girl. It's raised as a child.
And often, it's not until puberty, when it's growing and developing the breast -- but it doesn't have the menstrual period, when someone realizes something going on.
After doing tests they realize that instead of having <unk> and <unk> actually has <unk> and <unk>
The important thing to understand is that you can think this is a man, but it's actually not like that.
Women like men, we have in the body something called <unk> glands <unk>
They're in the back of the body.
<unk> glands produce <unk> the hormone <unk>
Most women like me -- I consider a <unk> woman -- I don't know its <unk> structure, I think being a typical woman most women like me are sensitive to the <unk>
We produce <unk> and we respond to <unk>
As a result, somebody like me has the most exposed brain to <unk> that the woman who was born with <unk> who has <unk> syndrome.
So sex is a complicated thing, it's not that the <unk> are in the middle of the <unk> in some form can be everywhere.
Another example: a few years ago I got a call from a 19-year-old who was born and raised as <unk> had girlfriend, and she had a sex with her, he was wearing a life as a guy and she had just found out he had <unk> and a lot.
He had an extreme form of a disease known as <unk> <unk> <unk>
He had the 20th chromosomes and the uterus -- the <unk> glands were so active that, in essence, creating a male hormone environment.
As a result, the <unk> were <unk> their brain was exposed to the hormone component typically the male.
He was born with <unk> no one <unk> anything.
And it was at the age of 19 when he started having medical problems caused by the internal <unk> when doctors discovered that in fact, was women in the inside.
Well, another quick example of a <unk> case.
Some people with the 20th chromosomes develop what's known as <unk> to say, they have <unk> tissue wrapped in <unk> tissue.
We don't know why this is going on.
So, there are many varieties of sex.
The reason that children with this kind of bodies are <unk> twins or <unk> twins or <unk> <unk> surgery is not to be able to have a better physical health.
In many cases people are perfectly healthy.
The reason that <unk> several surgeries are a threat to our social categories.
The system is usually based on the idea that a particular anatomy brings <unk> a particular identity.
We have the idea that being woman is to have <unk> <unk> <unk> being black means having an African anatomy in terms of historical terms.
A terribly simplistic idea.
And when you have a body that shows something quite different, we have problems with the <unk>
So we have very <unk> ideas in our culture about the <unk>
Our nation is based on a concept of <unk> very romantic.
Imagine how amazing it is to have children are born like two people in the same body.
The most recent case is last year with the <unk> South African <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> in the <unk> <unk>
A lot of journalists called to wonder: "What are you going to do to determine whether you're <unk> <unk> is man or <unk>
And I had to explain to the journalists that there is no such test.
In fact, we know that sex is so complicated that we have to admit that nature doesn't trace a <unk> between men and women or men and women and <unk> and women and <unk> we are all of us who draw that line.
So what we have is a situation where the more we go through the science, the more we have to admit that these categories -- we thought were categories.
And not just in terms of sex.
Also in terms of race, something that is much more complicated than the terminology <unk>
So as we see, we get into a <unk> terrain.
<unk> for example, the fact that we share at least 95 percent of the DNA with chimpanzees.
What about the fact of <unk> of them in just a few <unk>
And as we look at science we get into science and more and more in a awkward area where we have to recognize that <unk> categories are probably too <unk>
And we're looking at this in all walks of human life.
One of them, for example, in our current culture, in the United States today, are the struggles at the beginning and at the end of life.
It's hard to set up a moment from which a body becomes human, and it has different rights to the <unk>
There are very <unk> discussions today -- not in the audience, but I know within <unk> to when someone is considered dead.
Our ancestors never had to do with this question of whether someone was dead.
As a lot of him put a pen in front of the nose and if he moved still not to do it yet.
If I stopped moving the <unk>
But we can, for example, extract vital organs from a body and put them on another body.
And as a result, we need to address the dilemma of determine the death of somebody. And this puts us in a difficult situation where we don't have the simple categories of the past.
And you might think that this explosion of categories could be happy to someone like me.
In politics I'm a <unk> <unk> people with unusual bodies -- but I have to admit that I get nervous.
I mean, these categories are much more fragile than we thought we were going to do.
<unk> from the point of view of the concept of democracy.
And to tell you about this tension first I have to admit that I am a breakthrough one of the evil <unk>
I know they were <unk> I know they were <unk> but they were big.
I mean, they were so brave and audacious and so radical in what they did, that I find myself every single time watching that musical <unk> <unk> and not by the music, which is totally <unk>
This is why it happened in <unk> with the <unk>
And the parents would say -- they were to me, the first activists of the anatomy and tell you why.
What they <unk> was a <unk> concept and <unk> it with another one that was radical and beautiful and stayed for 200 years.
And as you all remember, what we would do, our parents were <unk> <unk> was the idea of <unk> <unk> was based on a very simplistic concept of anatomy.
The old world monarchs did not know the DNA, but they had clear the right idea of birth.
They had the concept of blue blood.
They were the idea that was coming into political power by the right of blood being passed away from the grandfather to father and then the son, etc.
The parents would say, "We had rejected that idea and sell it for a new <unk> concept, and that concept was that all men are created the same.
They <unk> the game field, and they decided that the anatomy that mattered was the anatomy in common and not <unk> differences that was very radical.
And partly they were doing it because they were part of a <unk> system where they were <unk> two things.
It was <unk> democracy and at the same time <unk> science.
And it's very clear that if you look at the story of the elites <unk> that many were very interested in science and the idea of a <unk> world.
They were <unk> of the <unk> explanations and therefore <unk> the concept of <unk> being passed through a <unk> <unk> idea.
They were moving into a <unk> concept.
And if you look at it, for example, the Declaration of <unk> they talk about nature and the god of nature.
They don't talk about God and the nature of God.
They talk about the power of nature to tell us who we are.
And it was a result, the idea of <unk> <unk>
And in doing so, they were <unk> the foundations of the future rights movement.
They didn't think about it, but they did it for us, and it was great.
And what happened next?
And the women.
Then it came to the success of the Civil Rights movement with people from <unk> <unk> who said, "I'm not a <unk>
We found men in the Civil Rights movement saying, "I'm a man."
So again, people in color that are <unk> to <unk> <unk> on the <unk> difference, and again, <unk>
We see the same with the movement of the <unk>
The problem is, of course, as we look at the <unk> we have to start asking why we keep certain <unk>
But you know, I want to keep some <unk> <unk> in our culture.
For example, I don't want to give a fish the same rights to a human.
I don't want to say that we should be <unk> before anatomy.
I don't want to say that the five years would be allowed to have sex or <unk>
There are some <unk> <unk> that for me make sense and that I think we should be <unk>
But the challenge is to try to figure out what they are, why they keep them and if they make sense.
Well, let's go back to those two beings, at the beginning of this talk.
We have two <unk> both <unk> at the <unk> exactly the same day.
Imagine that one of them, girls was born three months before the time: June June 1980.
Henry, on the contrary, it was born in term, was born on the March 1, 1980.
For the only fact that I had been born three months before Mary was attributed to all the rights three months before Henry -- the right of sexual consent -- the right to the vote, the right to <unk>
Henry has to wait for all that not because it has a biological age, but because he was born next.
We found other <unk> in relation to their rights.
Henry, in virtue of being considered a man -- if I haven't told you whether it's <unk> by virtue of being considered a man now is <unk> from the <unk> it doesn't have to worry about.
Mind for your part, it doesn't have the same rights for marriage in all states, for example.
Henry can marry all the states with a woman, but Mary can marry a woman in some states.
So still <unk> categories -- that in various aspects are <unk> and questionable.
And now the question is: What do we do now that science moved so much in the field of anatomy that we get to the point of having to admit that a democracy based on the anatomy might be <unk>
I don't want to give up to science, but at the same time sometimes I feel like science is <unk>
Where do we go from <unk>
It seems that what happens in our culture is kind of a <unk> attitude -- "Well, we need to draw the line somewhere, so we're going to do."
But many people are stuck in a strange position.
For example: Texas at a certain moment has decided that to marry a man you don't have to have chromosome up, and to marry a woman you have to get a <unk>
Now, in practice, they don't make tests for people.
But this is also very strange to the story that I told you at the beginning of <unk> syndrome.
If you look at one of the founding parents of modern democracy, Dr. Martin Luther King, in his speech, "I love <unk> offers a solution.
It says that we should judge people <unk> not in the color of their skin, but on the content of their <unk> going beyond anatomy.
And I want to say, "Yes, the idea looks very good.
But in practice, how do you do it?
How do we judge people based on the content of their <unk>
I want to point out that I'm not sure that I should be able to do this for <unk> rights to people, because I have to admit that I know some <unk> <unk> who probably deserve more social services than some humans I know.
I also want to say that maybe some <unk> that I know can make more intelligent <unk> decisions and <unk> about their sexual relationships that people from 40 I know.
So how do you put the theme of the content <unk>
It turns out very hard.
And a part of me asks what would happen if the character of a person could be measured to an instrument, maybe with an MRI <unk>
We want to actually get to that point?
I'm not sure where we go.
What I know is that it seems to be very important that the United States is still driving this current role of thinking relative to the subject of democracy.
We have done a good job in defense of democracy and I think we're going to do a good job in the future.
We don't live in -- for example, in a context like the Iranian in which a man who feels attracted to other men is susceptible to being <unk> unless they're willing to say to a sex change in which case it is allowed to live.
We're not in that situation.
I'm happy to say that we don't have a context as a surgeon that I talked about a couple of years ago that I had made to light twins, and then they pick up, and so they would give them their name.
But when the phone asked the point of the operation -- I was a very famous operation -- he told me that in that other country these kids would be very <unk> and therefore I had to do it.
I said, "Well, he has considered the political asylum instead of <unk> <unk>
America offers huge possibilities for people to be who are <unk> to change for the sake of the state.
So I think we need to be in the head.
Well, to finish up, I mean, I've been talking a lot about <unk>
And I want to think about what democracy would be, or as it might have been, if we had given more participation to the <unk>
And I want to say something a little bit radical for <unk> and that is that I think there may be different ideas from different <unk> <unk> particularly if there are people thinking about a group.
Since years ago, since I've been interested in the <unk> I've also been interested in looking at the sexual difference.
And one of the things that I've been interested in is the differences between men and women in terms of how to think and operate in the world.
And what we know about <unk> studies is that women, on average, not all, but in <unk> they tend to pay more attention to complex social relationships and to worry about those who are <unk> within the group.
And if we think about that, we have an interesting situation in our hands.
And years ago, when I was in graduate school, one of my advisers I knew I was interested in feminism <unk> I considered me <unk> like <unk> made me a <unk>
<unk> what has about female <unk>
And I thought, "It's the youngest question I've heard.
Feminism is about getting rid of rid of the gender stereotypes -- so there is no female in the <unk>
But the more I've thought about the question, the more I think there is some female on the <unk>
I mean, there might be something on average, something different between the brain and the male that makes us more <unk> to complex social relationships and willing to help the most vulnerable.
So if the parents were very aware of finding the way to protect people from the state, it's possible that, if we had more <unk> to this concept, maybe we would have enriched the concept of protection with the support of <unk>
And maybe that's what we need to do in the future when we get to democracy beyond <unk> thinking less in the individual body, in terms of identity and thinking more about relationships.
So as we try to create a more perfect <unk> let's think about what we do for each other.
Thank you.
In the year 2007, I decided that we had to <unk> how we think about economic development.
Our new goal should be that when every family thinks where they want to go to live and work, have the ability to choose between at least a handful of different cities that are competing for attracting new choices.
Well, right now we are far from that target.
There are billions of people in developing countries that don't have a single city willing to <unk>
But the amazing thing about cities is that it's worth a lot more than their building cost.
So we could easily go to the world -- maybe hundreds of new cities.
Well, this may sound absurd if you've never thought about new cities.
But it just went through building buildings as well.
Imagine that half of those people who wanted to live in apartments are already owners and the other half is still not likely to do that.
You could try to increase the capacity by doing <unk> all the existing buildings.
But you know that the problem that <unk> is that those buildings and areas around them have rules to avoid the <unk> and the ability of construction.
So it would be very hard to do all those <unk>
But they could go to a very new place, to build a whole new apartment building, always and when the rules of that particular place -- construction instead of putting <unk>
So I proposed that the governments -- new food areas that are large enough to contain cities and gave them a name, cities under <unk>
I later learned that more or less at the same time, <unk> and <unk> were thinking about the challenge of reform Honduras.
Did you know that every year around 75 people would come from their country to go to the United States, and they wanted to ask what they could do to make sure that those people could stay and do those same things in Honduras.
In the summer of 2009, <unk> happened by a constitutional crisis.
In the next couple of <unk> <unk> <unk> they took a platform out of a platform in which <unk> reforms and at the same time reconciliation.
He asked her to be his head of <unk>
Meanwhile, I was preparing to give a talk in TEDGlobal.
Through a process of <unk> trial and error and a lot of evidence with users, I tried to reduce this complicated concept of cities under their more fundamental ideas.
The first point was the importance of the rules, like those rules that say you can't go and nurture all the current residents in apartments.
So we have a lot of attention to new technologies, but it takes so much of technologies like the rules of <unk> and they're usually the rules that prevent us forward.
In the fall of 2010, a friend of Guatemala was sent to <unk> a link with the <unk>
He showed it to <unk>
They called me up.
They said, "You know, this is the leaders of our <unk>
So in December we met in Miami, in a conference room.
I tried to explain to you this point about how valuable cities are much more valuable than its cost <unk>
And I used this image that shows the value of land in a place like New York <unk> terrain that in some cases, it's worth thousands of dollars per square meter.
But it was a pretty abstract discussion -- and at some point, when there was a pause, he said, <unk> maybe we could see the video of the <unk> talk.
And the talk described in very simple terms that a city under <unk> is a place where you start with <unk> <unk> a <unk> that <unk> the rules that are going down there and a choice for people to choose whether they want to go or not live under those norms.
So the president of <unk> was called, and he told me that we had to do this project, this is important, this could be the way that our country <unk>
He asked me to go to <unk> and I would talk about the four and five of January.
So I presented another talk full of data, which included a picture like this, which was trying to explain that to <unk> a lot of value to a city, this has to be very big.
This is a picture of <unk> and the white line is the new airport that was built in <unk>
Only this airport is covers over 100 square miles.
So I was trying to convince the <unk> that to build a new city, you have to start with a site that is about 1,000 square miles.
That's over 100,000 acres.
Everybody <unk> <unk>
The face of the public were very serious and <unk>
The Congress was approached to the platform and said, "Professor <unk> thank you very much for your talk, but maybe you could see the video of the <unk> talk.
I have this in my <unk>
So I sat down and showed the <unk>
And this explained that a new city can offer new choices for people.
There would be an option in a city that might be going to be in <unk> rather than hundreds of miles away from distance up.
And also <unk> new options for leaders.
Because the U.S. government leaders would need aid from countries -- they could benefit from the countries that are associated with to help them establish and make the standards of <unk> so that they could all be able to trust the <unk> effectively <unk>
We went and we saw a site.
This picture is there.
It could easily take a thousand square miles.
And shortly after, the 19 of January, voted in Congress to <unk> his Constitution and add a constitutional willingness to allow us to create these special regions of development.
In a country I had just gone through this crisis, the voting in Congress for this <unk> <unk> was <unk> to one.
All the ones who are in the society, the <unk>
In the <unk> it has to pass twice in Congress.
February 17 passed over to another voting -- <unk> to one.
Immediately after the voting from 21 to 24 of February, a <unk> <unk> was to the two places in the world that are most interested in engaging in building cities.
One of them is South Korea.
This is a picture of a new center of the city that's building in Korea that's bigger than the center of Boston.
Everything you see there was built in four years after you spent four years to get the <unk>
The other interest in building cities is Singapore.
In fact, they've already built two cities in China and are preparing for a third.
And if you think about this practical mode. This is the point where we are.
They have a site, and they're already thinking about a site for the second city.
They're preparing a legal system that would allow the <unk> <unk> and then they could operate under a foreign legal system.
A country has already committed to allow its Supreme Court to be the last sentence to be the last sentence for this new <unk> system.
There are <unk> and builders of cities that are very interested in the project.
They can even get some funding.
But the only thing we know you've already solved is that they have a good number of people.
There are a lot of companies that wanted to be installed in <unk> especially in a place with a free trade zone, and there's a lot of people who would like to go to live there.
In the world there are 700 million people who say they would like to change it immediately to another place.
There's a million a year that comes out of Latin America to go to the United States.
Many of them are parents who have to leave their family to go and get a job -- sometimes they're young mothers who have to earn money to just eat or buy clothes.
Unfortunately, sometimes even children who are trying to meet with their parents who haven't seen, in some cases, in a decade.
So what does it look like to think about building a new city in <unk>
Or build a dozen of these, or a hundred of these all over the world?
What does it look like to think about insist that families can choose between various cities that are competing for attracting new <unk>
This is an idea worth spreading.
And my friends, I was asked to say, "Thank TED <unk>
I'm <unk> and this is my <unk>
But before I show you what there is inside, I'm going to make a <unk> and that is that I live obsessed with <unk>
I love to find, too, and more recently, to photograph and post in my blog <unk> and colorful <unk> and different for every time.
But I don't buy anything new.
All my clothes is <unk> of <unk> markets and <unk> stores.
Oh, thank you.
The second hand stores allow me to reduce the impact of my <unk> in the environment and in my <unk>
I go back to know people -- usually my money goes to a good <unk> My aspect is <unk> and buy it becomes my personal search for <unk>
I mean, what am I going to find today?
It will be from my size?
Would you like color color.
It will cost less than 20 dollars?
If all of the answers are positive, then I feel that I've won.
So going back to the theme of my <unk> I want to tell you what I would do, for this exciting week at TED.
I mean, what brings up someone who has all that <unk>
So I'm going to show you exactly what I suit.
I've brought seven pairs of clothing and nothing else.
So inside for a week is everything I've put in my <unk>
I thought that I would be able to find everything else I'd like to use after I get here to <unk> <unk>
And because they don't know me as the woman who walks for TED on inner clothes,  that means I found some things.
And I'd like to show you now the sets for this week.
It doesn't sound interesting?
So while I do, I'm also going to tell you some of the lessons of life that believe or not, I've learned in this adventure of not using new clothes.
Let's start with Sunday.
This is a brilliant tiger <unk>
You don't have to spend a lot of money to look good.
You almost always see a great deal about 50 dollars.
All together, including <unk> took me <unk> and it's the most expensive I've ever used in the week.
<unk> the color is energy.
It's almost <unk> it's impossible to be <unk> when you're wearing a brilliant red <unk>
If you're happy, you're going to attract other people happy.
<unk> <unk> is <unk>
I've spent a lot of time in life trying to be myself and at the same time.
Just yourself.
If you get out of the right people, not only do you give you <unk> you also love you.
<unk> <unk> of the child that carry inside.
Sometimes people tell me it seems to be playing the <unk> or I remember their little <unk>
I like <unk> and say, <unk>
<unk> trust is the key.
If you think you look good at something, it's pretty sure you are.
And if you think you don't look good at something, it's probably true.
My mother taught me this day after day.
But it wasn't until the 30 years that I really understood their meaning.
And I'm going to explain it in a few seconds.
If you think you're a beautiful person in your interior and outside, you don't have a look at <unk>
So there's no excuse for anyone in this audience.
We must be able to achieve everything we want to do.
Thank you.
<unk> A universal truth six words for you. The golden <unk> go with everything.
And finally, <unk> <unk> a personal style is a great way to tell the world something about you without having to say a word.
I've tried it over and over again when people were approaching this week simply by what I was using, and we had fantastic conversations.
Obviously this is not going to go into my little <unk>
So before I went home, to Brooklyn, I'm going to donate everything.
Because the lesson I'm trying to learn this week is that you have to leave a certain bit of things.
I don't need to make it emotionally to these things, because at the end of the corner, there will always be another crazy suit, <unk> and brilliant <unk> if there is a little love in my heart and I go.
Thank you very much.
Thank you.
This is a representation of your brain that we can split in two parts.
The left side -- which is the logic, and the right side, which is the intuitive part of it.
So if you take a scale to measure the <unk> of every <unk> we could design a blueprint for our brain.
For example, this would be somebody who's completely logical.
This would be somebody who's totally intuitive.
So, where do you get your brain at this scale?
Some of the people are <unk> but I think for most members of this audience, their brain is something like -- with a big <unk> in both <unk> at the same time.
It's not that they're mutually <unk>
You can be logical and intuitive.
I consider myself one of those people, who just like most of the other quantum quantum physicists <unk> we need a lot of logic to address these complicated ideas.
But at the same time, we need a lot of intuition to make experiments really work.
How do we develop this <unk> Well, we like to play with things.
We are going to play with them and then we see the <unk> and then we developed our intuition from that point.
And actually, you do the same thing.
One of the other intuition that you may have developed over the year is what it says that one thing can be only in a place at once.
I mean, it may sound weird to think that one thing is in two different places at the same time, but you weren't born with this <unk> <unk>
I remember watching a child playing in a parking lot.
It was a small kid and I didn't do it very well, it always always was.
But I bet you play with that bar of parking lot taught a valuable lesson, and that is that the big things don't allow the <unk> and that stay in a place.
This is a great conceptual model that you can have in the world, except you're a particle physicist.
It would be a terrible model for a particle physicist because they don't play with parking bars, they play with these strange little particles.
And when they play with their particles, they find that they do all sorts of really weird things -- like they can go through walls, or they can be in two different places at the same time.
And then they wrote all these observations, and they called it theory of quantum mechanics.
At that point there was the physics of a few years ago, you needed from quantum mechanics to describe those little particles.
But not the needed to describe the big objects around us every day.
That didn't fit very well to my intuition, and maybe it's because I don't play very often with particles.
Well, sometimes I play with them, but not a lot.
And I've never seen it.
I mean, no one saw a <unk>
But it didn't fit well to my logic.
Because if everything is made of little particles and all the little particles follow the principles of quantum mechanics, then it shouldn't all follow the principles of quantum mechanics.
I don't find the reason why they shouldn't have.
And so I would feel much better if I could somehow prove that a common object is still following the principles of quantum mechanics.
That's why a few years ago, I set out to do exactly that.
And I did.
This is the first object that you can see that it's been on an overlap of quantum mechanics.
What we see here is a little computer chip.
And you can try to see the green point right in the middle.
That's the piece of metal that I'm going to talk about in a minute.
This is a picture of the object.
And here I'm going to zoom in a little bit right here at the center.
And then here we make a fine approach, a little bit of metal.
So what we see is a little bit of metal little bit of metal, and that <unk> in a platform.
And then I did this almost the same way you would do a computer chip.
I went to a clean room with a silicon chip chip and put all the big machines for about 100 hours.
For the last material, I had to build my own machine -- to make this hole in a form of <unk> <unk> which is under the device.
This device has the ability to be in an overlap -- but it needs a little help.
Let me make an analogy.
You know how uncomfortable it is to be in an elevator full of people.
I mean, when I'm on an elevator alone, I do all kinds of weird things, but then when other people get up to do those things, because I don't want to hear it, or, actually, <unk>
Quantum mechanics says that inanimate objects behave in the same way.
<unk> of inanimate objects are not only people, it's also the light that <unk> and the wind that happens to the side and the heat of the room.
So we knew that if we wanted this little bit of metal to behave according to quantum mechanics, we would have to <unk> all the other Americans.
And that's what we did.
It will take away the lights and then <unk> a <unk> and we pulled it all the air, and then we would bring it to a temperature less than a degree above absolute zero.
Now, by being only in the <unk> the little piece of metal is free to act as wants.
So we measured its movements.
We found that it moved in very strange ways.
Instead of staying perfectly still, she was idealistic. And the way it was, it was like a breath in this way -- like a <unk> which expands and <unk>
And by giving him a smooth drive, we were able to make it <unk> and that we don't get to the same time -- something that only happens with quantum mechanics.
So what I'm telling you is really fantastic.
What does it mean one thing <unk> and not <unk> at the same time?
Let's think about atoms.
In one case, all the trillions of atoms that make that piece of metal are still and at the same time those same atoms are moving up and down.
It's just in certain <unk> when those are <unk>
In the rest of the time you're <unk>
It means that every single atom is in two different places at the same time, which means that all the metal piece is in two different places.
I think this is great.
Really.
<unk> <unk> in a clean room to do this for all those years, because, look at this, the difference on the scale between one atom and that piece of metal is roughly the same as the difference between that piece of metal and you.
So if one single atom can be in two different places at the same time, and that piece of metal can be in two different places, why not you well?
I mean, it's my logic part of speech.
So imagine if they were in a number of places at the same time, how would that be?
How do you act your consciousness if your body was <unk> in space?
There's another part of the story.
And it's when we put it, and we turned the lights and look inside the box, and we saw that the metal was still there in one piece.
And I could get to this new intuition, seemingly all the objects on the elevator actually only are quantum objects that are just <unk> in a small space.
You hear a lot about that quantum mechanics <unk> that everything is interconnected.
Well, that's not so good.
It's more than that, it's more profound.
It's that those connections, your connections to all of the things that around you, literally define who you are, and that's the deep significance of quantum mechanics.
Thank you.
My name is <unk>
And 18 months ago, I was doing another job at Google, until I launched the idea of doing something related to museums and art to my head and that allowed me to get it.
It took me 18 months.
Lots of negotiations and stories, <unk> with 17 very interesting museums in nine countries.
But I'm going to focus on <unk>
There's a lot of stories of why we did it.
I think my own story explains just this slide, and this is the access.
I grew up in India.
<unk> of a great education -- not <unk> but I didn't have access to many of these museums and artwork.
So when I started traveling and go to museums I started learning a lot.
And working on Google, I try to make the desire to make it more accessible by technology.
So we formed a team, a great team of people, and we started doing it.
Better to show you the demo to then explain a couple of interesting things that we have done from their launch.
So, <unk> we're going to <unk>
Look around all the museums there are.
There is the gallery and the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
I'm actually going to go into one of my favorite <unk> the art museum in New York.
There are two ways to do it -- very simple.
We click and <unk> we're already inside the museum.
It doesn't matter where they are, <unk> or <unk> that doesn't really matter.
You move around and you get <unk>
They want to navigate for the <unk>
We opened up the top, and with one click, we jumped inside.
They're inside, they want to go at the end of the hall,
They go forward. It gets <unk>
<unk>
Thank you, but I haven't come to the best.
Now I'm in front of one of my favorite paintings, "The <unk> of Pieter <unk> in the <unk>
I see the <unk> sign of it.
If the museum shows us the image, we click there.
See, this is one of the images.
Here's all the <unk> information.
For those of you who are really interested in art, you can click there, but I'm going to click here right now.
And this is one of the images that we have captured what we call <unk> technology.
So this picture -- for example, <unk> I think, about 10 million minutes.
And there are many people who ask me, "What do you get with 10,000 million <unk>
So I'm going to show you what you really get with 10,000 million users.
You can zoom in in a very simple way.
You see some fun things that are happening.
I love this guy, his expression has no price.
But if you really would want to do it.
So I began to play, and I found something that was going on there.
And I said, "A moment, this seems <unk>
I entered and found that the kids were actually playing something.
So a little bit of a little bit, I talked to some people from the <unk> and I actually found that this is a game called <unk> which is to hit a <unk> with a stick with the Tuesday Tuesday Tuesday shot.
And apparently it was very popular.
I don't know why they did, but I've learned something about it.
And now we're going to get even deeper and you'll see that you can actually get to the cracks.
Now just to give you a little bit of perspective, I'm going to pull the picture, you see what there is.
Here's where we were, and this is the painting.
The best thing is to come, a second.
So now we're quickly going to jump over again at MoMA in New York.
Here's another one of my favorite night.
The example I showed was to find details.
But what if you want to see the <unk>
And if you want to see how Van Gogh is actually created this <unk>
It goes up and really <unk>
I'm going to one of my favorite parts in this painting, and I'm really going to get to the cracks.
This is <unk> <unk> I think I'd never seen it that before.
I'm going to show you another one of my favorite functions.
There are a lot of things over here, but I don't have time to do it.
This is the really cool part. It's called <unk>
All of you, absolutely everyone, no matter whether it's rich or poor, or if you have a <unk> that gives the same.
You can make your own museum, create your own collection from all these images.
It's very simple, we walked in, I've created this function that I call <unk> <unk> -- we just made a zoom in.
It's about "The <unk> in the National Gallery in London.
You can write things out, send it to your friends and keep a conversation about what you feel at contemplating these works <unk>
So in conclusion, I think for me, the main thing is that all incredible things don't come from Google.
No, in my opinion, even of the museums.
Maybe I shouldn't say this.
Actually, they come from those artists.
And that's been my humble experience with this.
I mean, I hope in this digital medium to do justice to the work of art and that is represented online online.
And the big question I'm doing today is, "You did this to repeat the experience of going to a <unk> <unk>
And the answer is no.
It's to supplement the experience.
And that's it. Thank you.
Thank you.
Good evening everybody.
I have something to show you.
Think of it a <unk> <unk>
In our lab we call it sensitive design.
I'm going to tell you a little bit about this.
If you look at this picture -- I'm from origin -- all the kids in Italy grow up with this photo on the wall of his bedroom. But the reason I show you this is that has happened something very interesting in the race for games -- one in the last two decades.
A few time ago, if you wanted to win a race for him, one was taking a budget, and you would take it to a good pilot and a good car.
And if the car and the pilot were good enough, you made the career.
This is what in engineering, it was <unk> in real time.
It's essentially a system that has two <unk> a sensor and a <unk>
The interesting thing is that the control systems in real time are starting to enter our lives.
Our cities, in the last few years, have been covered with networks and electronics.
They're going to be <unk>
And, as <unk> they're starting to respond differently and can be <unk> and <unk>
<unk> cities is a big thing.
As a note -- but I wanted to mention that cities are only two percent of the cortex of the planet but they represent 50 percent of the <unk> population.
75 percent of the consumption of <unk> and to 80 percent of the CO2 emissions.
If we could do something with cities, it would be a big thing.
Beyond cities, all these <unk> and <unk> are entering our everyday objects.
This is from an exhibit of <unk> <unk> for the end of <unk> during the summer.
It's called <unk> to <unk> <unk>
Well, our objects, the environment, start <unk>
It is sort of as if almost all of the existing atoms were going to become sensors and <unk>
And that's changing the interaction that as humans have with the outside environment.
In some sense, it's almost like the old dream of Miguel <unk>
You know, when Michelangelo <unk> the <unk> it says that at the end I took the <unk> and he threw it up to Moses -- and he was able to still see a little bit of a <unk> and he said, "You know, <unk> <unk> -- and he said, <unk> <unk> <unk>
Well, today, for the first time, our environment begins to <unk>
And I'm just going to show you just about <unk> <unk> in the idea of taking the environment and run something.
Let's start with the detection of it.
The first project I wanted to share with you is actually one of the first projects in our lab.
This was four years ago in Italy.
It was a summer for 2006.
It was the year that Italy won the World Cup <unk>
Maybe some of the people remember it, and they played <unk> and France, and at the end, he gave the <unk>
And anyway, I won Italy.
Now let's see what happened now that day by looking at <unk> activity in the network.
Here we see the city.
You see the <unk> in the middle and the river <unk>
It's the morning, before the game.
The time line is at the top.
At the evening, there are people around here and there by making <unk>
It starts the <unk> silence.
<unk> from France.
<unk> people make a quick call and the bathroom.
Second time, End of time.
First time <unk> second.
<unk> and at a moment, the <unk>
She makes Italy, Italy, yeah!
That night everybody went to the center.
There you see the big summit.
The next day everybody was at the center of the winner and the first minister of then.
And then the whole world <unk>
You see the picture of the place called <unk> <unk> where, from the time <unk> people are going to <unk> it's a great party, you can see the peak at the end of the day.
This is just an example of how you can measure the pulse of the city in a way that we wouldn't have been able to do a few years ago.
Another quick example of <unk> isn't about people, but of things we use and consume.
So today we know everything about our objects.
This is a map that shows all of the chips that make up a Mac, how it was <unk>
But we know very little about where things go.
So in this project, we developed some small tags to track the trash in its shift in the system.
We started with a few volunteers who helped us in Seattle a little bit more than a year ago, to tag what they were <unk> different kinds of things, as you can see, things that are sort of <unk>
Then we put a little chip, one tag on the garbage and then we started <unk>
These are the results.
From <unk>
after a week.
With this information we realized that there are a lot of <unk> in the system.
We can do the same with much less energy.
These are data that didn't exist before.
They're going on complicated things, and there's a lot of <unk>
But the other thing that we think is that if we look at every day that the cup that the cup that we don't know, it's still somewhere on the planet.
And if the plastic bottle that we <unk> a day still stays there.
And if we show that to people, then we can promote any change of behavior.
That was the reason for the project.
My colleague at MIT, <unk> <unk> could tell us much more about detecting and many other things that we can do with that, but I wanted to go to the second part that we talked about at the beginning, which is actually driven on the environment.
And the first project is something we did a couple of years ago in <unk>
It all began with a question of the mayor of the city, which came and told us that Spain and South Europe have a beautiful tradition of water in public spaces in the architecture.
And the question was, how can technology, the new technology, join that?
And one of the ideas that we developed at MIT, in a garage, was, imagine you have a <unk> and <unk> valves and <unk> valves that open and <unk>
It creates like a <unk> <unk> with water.
If the pixels fall out of the pixels you can write patterns, show patterns, images, texts.
And when you zoom in, the curtain will open up so that we can go and see in the image.
We presented this to the mayor <unk>
He liked it a lot.
And we had a commission to design the building to the input of <unk>
We call it the competition <unk>
All the building is made of water.
There is no windows and no windows and when you get to turn it up so that you can happen.
The ceiling is also covered in water.
And if there's a bit of wind, if you want to minimize the <unk> you get down the roof.
Or you can close the building and all the architecture is disappears, like in this case.
Those days, there will always be somebody in the winter, when the roof, they go down the roof, and he said, <unk> the <unk>
No, it's not that you've got it <unk> but when you go down almost all the architecture goes away.
Here's how it works.
You see the people <unk> so it happens inside.
And here I am myself trying not to be able to prove the sensors that open up water.
I think I should tell you what happened one night when all the sensors stopped working.
That night was actually even more funny.
All the <unk> kids came to the building, because the way we interact with had changed a little bit.
It was no longer a building that would open to leave you -- it's going to happen, but a building that kept doing <unk> and holes in water, and you had to jump in for not <unk>
<unk> <unk> And for us that was very interesting because as architects, engineers, designers, we always think about use people to give them our designs.
But then it's always unpredictable.
And that's the beauty of doing things that people use.
This is a picture of the building with the physical pixels the pixels of water, and from projections about them.
And this is what led us to think about the next project I'm going to show you.
Imagine that those pixels could begin to fly.
Imagine that they could have little helicopters in the air, and that each one had a little pixel that changes color as if it was a cloud that moves in space.
This is the video.
Imagine a helicopter, which we saw before, which moves with others in <unk>
We could form this cloud,
This sort of flexible screen like this with a normal configuration in two dimensions.
Or a normal, but in three dimensions, that what changes is the light, not the position of the roof.
You can play with a different guy.
Imagine that the screen appears in different scales and sizes, in different types of resolution.
And that then all that could be a cloud of pixels in 3D that you can zoom in, and you can see from very different <unk>
This is the real <unk> <unk> going down to form a <unk> like before.
When the light, you see this. The same thing we saw before.
Imagine each of them controlled by one person.
We can have each pixel with a input that comes from people, from the movement of people, and so on. etc.
I want to show you something for the first time.
We've been working with <unk> <unk> <unk> of the best dancers of today, the <unk> star of New York City and <unk> to capture its 3D movements and use it as input for the <unk>
Here we can see <unk> dancing.
On the left you see the <unk> the capture in different <unk>
It's so much 3D <unk> in real time as it capture.
It can <unk> all the movement.
You can go through the way.
And once we have the pixels we can play with them, with color and movement, with gravity and <unk>
We want to use this as a possible input for the <unk>
I wanted to show you the last project we're working on.
It's something for the London Olympics.
It's called the <unk>
And the idea is, imagine again, that we could get people involved in order to do something and change our environment, like a <unk> farm like <unk> but with a cloud.
Imagine that we could make all of them a little bit for a <unk>
And I think what remarkable has happened in the last few years is that, in the last two decades, we went from the physical world to the digital world.
We've digitized everything, like knowledge and accessible to the Internet.
Today, for the first time -- and the Obama campaign -- we can go through the digital world -- we can go from the digital power of the power to the physical world.
In our case, this may be that we wanted to use it to design and make a <unk>
That would mean something built in a city.
But tomorrow it can be to address the challenges of today: think about climate change or CO2 emissions, how to move from the digital world to the physical world.
The idea is that we can make people involved in doing this together, <unk>
The cloud is a cloud, again, made of pixels in the same way that the real cloud is a cloud cloud.
And those particles are water, whereas in our cloud are the roof.
It's a physical structure in London, but it's covered in the roof.
You can move inside, have different experiences.
You can see from the bottom, to do to share the major moments of the Olympics for 2012, and even more, and it can be used as a way of connection with the community.
So, it's so much a physical cloud of the sky as something that you can go up as a new top of London.
You can get into there.
As if it was a new digital <unk> at night, but the most important thing is to be a new experience for anyone who goes to the top.
Thank you.
Would you like to be better than they are.
Suppose I told you that, with just a few changes in your genes, they could improve the <unk> by more accurate and faster.
Or maybe they would like to be in better shape, to be stronger to have more resistance.
Would you like to be more attractive and secure
How about good health?
Or maybe these people who always wanted to be more creative.
What is the most <unk>
What would you like to, if you could choose something?
<unk> from the Audience: <unk> <unk>
How many people do you with creativity?
Raise your hand. Let me see.
<unk> should probably be the amount of creative people present.
That's very good.
How many of you want to pick the memory?
A few more.
And the <unk> state.
A little less.
How about <unk>
Oh, most of them, that makes me feel very well as a doctor.
If you could have some of this the world would be very different.
It's just <unk>
Or maybe it's possible?
Evolution has been a theme issue here at the TED conference but today I want to give you a doctor of a doctor on the subject.
The great renaissance of the 20th century, <unk> <unk> who also <unk> in the Church of <unk> <unk> wrote an essay called "No meaning in biology -- it makes sense of <unk>
But if you actually accept biological evolution, consider this: it's just the past, or the future?
Is it about other or us?
This is another look at the tree of life.
The human part of this branch, well on one end is, of course, the more we interested.
<unk> from a common ancestor with modern chimpanzees about six or eight million years ago.
There have been maybe 20 to 25 different species of <unk>
Some have gone and <unk>
We've been here about <unk> years.
It might seem like we're very far from other parts of this tree of life, but actually mostly the basic machinery of our cells is sort of the same.
You realize that we can leverage and control the machinery of a common bacteria to produce the protein of human insulin that is used to treat <unk>
This is not like human insulin -- but it's the same protein, which is <unk> that comes from pancreatic
And talking about bacteria -- they realize that we all carry on the <unk> the cells that the cells we have in the rest of the body?
Maybe 10 times more.
I mean, think -- when Antonio <unk> gives you the <unk> you think about <unk>
The gut is a beautifully <unk> environment for those bacteria.
It's warm hot -- it's very <unk>
And we're going to give you all the nutrients that you can want to have no effort of their <unk>
It's really like a quick way to bacteria with the occasional disruption of some rush <unk> towards the way.
But by others, we are a wonderful environment for those bacteria in the same way that they are essential for our life.
They help digest nutrients and protect us from certain diseases.
But what would we tell us the future?
We're in an evolutionary balance as a species?
Or meant to become something different, something maybe better <unk>
In this vast <unk> symphony of the universe, life on Earth is like a brief <unk> the animal kingdom, as a single and unique human life, a little note of grace.
That was us.
And it was also the <unk> part of this talk so I hope you have <unk>
When I first went to college, I had my first class of biology.
It was fascinated by <unk> and beauty of biology.
I fell in love with the power of evolution and I realized something fundamental to me in most existence of life, in <unk> organisms, every cell simply divide and all the genetic energy of that cell is transmitted to the two daughters.
But when organisms come up, things start to change.
It goes in the sexual reproduction.
And something very important -- with the emergence of sexual reproduction that passes the genome, the rest of the body becomes <unk>
In fact, you might say that the <unk> of the body is going into evolution at the same time of sexual reproduction.
I have to <unk> that when I was a college student, I was thinking, well, <unk> <unk> death by <unk> seemed quite reasonable at that time, but with every year that was happening, I had more <unk>
I came to understand the feelings of George <unk> who still <unk> in Las Vegas in their 90 years.
And one night somebody hits his hotel door to him.
He opens the door.
In front of him there is a magnificent <unk>
He looks at it and he says, <unk> looking for a <unk> <unk>
"It's fine. says, George, "I choose the <unk>
I realized, as a doctor, I was working for a different target to the goal of <unk> not necessarily different.
I was trying to preserve the body.
I wanted to make us healthy.
I wanted to recover health into the disease.
I wanted it to live more and more healthy.
Evolution is about spending the genome on the next <unk> adapting and generation generation after generation.
From an evolutionary point of view, you and I are like <unk> rockets designed to send the genetic burden on the next level, and then let us fall into the sea.
I think that all of us will <unk> the feeling that expressed Allen when he said, "I don't want to achieve immortality through my work.
I want to <unk> not <unk>
Evolution doesn't necessarily keep longevity.
It doesn't necessarily benefit the biggest or the stronger or even the smarter.
Evolution benefits the best adapted to their environment.
That's the only test for survival and success.
In the bottom of the ocean the bacteria <unk> the bacteria can survive the heat of the <unk> that they <unk> if there were fish there, fish <unk> the <unk> yet they've managed to do that a <unk> environment.
So what does this mean? When we look at what's happening in evolution and if we go back to think about the place of humans in evolution and in particular, if we look forward, at the stage, I would say there are many possibilities.
The first one is that I don't know.
We've reached a kind of balance.
And the underlying reasoning that is that through medicine, first of all, we have known to preserve a lot of genes that otherwise would have been <unk> and dependent on the population.
And secondly, as a species, we have <unk> our environment so that it could be adapted to us as we adapt to it.
And by the way, <unk> <unk> and <unk> so much that you can't have the necessary isolation for us to happen.
A second possibility is that you can make a normal kind of evolution of the natural type, imposed by the forces of nature.
And the argument here is, that the balance of evolution roll slowly, but they're <unk>
And as soon as the <unk> as a species -- distant planets, distant planets are going to be the isolation and environmental changes that can produce evolution <unk>
But there is a third possibility, a sexy possibility, intriguing and terrifying possibility.
I call it <unk> the new evolution, which is not just <unk> but <unk> and elected by us as individuals in the decisions that we have.
Now, how could this happen?
How could we get to do this?
First you think of the reality that many people today, in some cultures, are making decisions about their offspring.
In some cultures, they're choosing to have more males than women.
It's not necessarily good for society, but it's what is <unk> and family and familiar.
Think about it as well as possible to be able to choose not just sex from your <unk> but in your own body to make the genetic prevention to cure or prevent disease.
And if we could make the genetic changes to remove diabetes or Alzheimer's or reduce the risk of cancer or eliminate the <unk>
You wouldn't want to make those changes in your <unk>
If we look at the future that kind of changes will be increasingly possible.
The Human Genome Project, started in 1990 and sued 13 years.
<unk> <unk> million dollars.
The next year of being done, in 2004, I could do the same job for 20 million dollars in three or four months.
Now you can get a complete sequence of the three billion base pairs of the human genome at a cost about 20,000 and a week.
It's not going to be a lot for us to actually make the human genome -- and to be increasingly aware of all of us.
They come out of those changes.
The same technology that has produced the human insulin in bacteria can make viruses that are not only going to protect us from themselves but they're going to induce immunity.
<unk> or there is no experimental trial in the course of <unk> <unk> in cells from a <unk> plant.
You can imagine something nice to go out of the <unk>
That's actually today and the future is going to be increasingly possible.
Imagine then only another two little <unk>
They can change the cells in their bodies but if they could change the cells from their <unk>
And if they could change the sperm and the <unk> or change the newborn egg and give their children a better chance of a healthier life, to remove diabetes to reduce the risk of cancer?
Who doesn't want children more <unk>
And then, that same <unk> technology, that same engine of science that can produce the changes to prevent diseases will also allow us to adopt <unk> <unk> a better memory.
Why don't you have a ingenuity of <unk> <unk> especially if you could <unk> with the next generation of the machine <unk>
Why not have a <unk> muscle that allowed us to run faster and more <unk>
Why don't you live longer?
This is going to be <unk>
And when we're in conditions to pass this into the next generation and we can adopt the attributes that we wanted to have become the evolution of before in the <unk>
We're going to take a process that normally could take 100,000 years and we can give it to 1,000 years and maybe happened in the next 100 years.
These are choices that their grandchildren, or grandchildren of their grandchildren, are going to have to have them.
We're going to use these options into a better society and a better society, more <unk>
Or, let's choose different attributes that we want for some of us, but not for everybody else?
We're going to build a society that is more boring and more robust or more robust and more <unk>
This is the kind of question we're going to have to face.
And the deeper of all, we're going to be able to develop wisdom and <unk> the wisdom needed to make these <unk> decisions.
For good or for worse, and before I could do it -- these options will depend on us.
Thank you.
Imagine a big explosion when you're at 900 feet tall at home.
Imagine an airplane filled with smoke.
Imagine a engine doing <unk> <unk> <unk>
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> It sounds terrifying.
Well, I had a unique seat that day. I was sitting in the <unk>
It was the only one I could talk about flight workers.
So I immediately looked at them, and they said, "There's no problem. You would give some <unk>
The pilot had already taken off the airplane, and we weren't so far.
You could see Manhattan.
Two minutes later, three things happened at the same time.
The pilot would lay the airplane with the Hudson River.
It's often not the road.
<unk> the engines.
Imagine being on a plane and without <unk>
And then he said three words ...
The three <unk> words ever heard.
He said, <unk> for the <unk>
I didn't have to talk more about the flight.
I was able to see it in his eyes.
It was terror.
I want to share with you three things I learned about myself that day.
I learned that everything changes in a second.
We have this list of things to do before they die, these things that we want to do in life, and I thought about all the people I wanted to get in, and I didn't do it, all the fences that I wanted to have and never <unk>
While I was thinking about it, I came up with a sentence, which is, <unk> wines <unk>
Because if the wine is ready and the person is there, I'm going to set it up.
I don't want to do anything in life.
And that issue, that way, has really changed my life.
The second thing I learned that day -- and this is while I was <unk> the George Washington, which was not very much -- I thought about -- wow, I really feel a great <unk>
I've lived a good life.
In my humanity and my errors I've tried to improve everything I did.
But in my humanity I also gave place to my ego.
And I'm sorry for the time you get in things that didn't care about people who matter.
And I thought about my relationship with my wife, with my friends, with people.
And then as a <unk> in that, I decided to eliminate the negative energy of my life.
It's not perfect, but it's much better.
In two years, I haven't had a fight with my wife.
It feels like <unk>
I'm no longer trying to be <unk> <unk> to be <unk>
The third thing I learned -- and this is how your mental clock is <unk> <unk> <unk>
You see the water <unk>
I'm saying, "Please <unk>
I don't want this to be broken in 20 pieces as you see in those <unk>
And as I <unk> I had the feeling of, wow, I will die not fear.
It's almost like we've been <unk> for it all our life.
But it was very sad.
I didn't want to say, I love my life.
And that sadness <unk> in a single thought, which is, I just wish one thing.
I wish I could see my children growing.
A month later, I was in an performance of my daughter -- a first grade, not a lot of artistic talent --   And I scream, <unk> like a small one.
And for me, that was the whole reason to be the world.
In that point, I got to connect those two points, which is the only thing that matters in my life is to be a great father.
For most of all, the only goal I have in life is to be a good father.
I was given a miracle, not to die that day.
And it gave me another gift, which was the possibility of looking at the future and come back and live in another way.
You are flying today, the challenge you can imagine the same thing on your plane -- and please not be like that -- but imagine, and how do you <unk>
What is it that they are still expecting to do because they think they're going to live <unk>
How would your relationships change and negative energy in them?
And most importantly, they're the best parents who are <unk>
Thank you.
I've clearly been <unk> in life with many projects.
But the greatest thing I worked on was for this guy.
The guy is called <unk>
<unk> was one of the most important <unk> in the '80s.
One day came home after running and said, "Dad, I feel a <unk> in the <unk>
And that was the beginning of ALS.
Today we have total paralysis, and total curiosity.
You can only use your eyes.
Her work influenced me.
I have a design company and animation so, obviously, graffiti is something intricate that we admire and <unk> in the world of art.
So we decided that we were going to <unk> <unk> <unk> and their cause.
So I went and I met with her brother and her father and I said, "We're going to give you this money.
What are you going to do with <unk>
And his brother said, "I just want to be able to talk to Tony again.
I just want to communicate with him and that he's able to communicate with me."
And I said, "A second, it's not that you see Stephen <unk> not all the people with paralysis can communicate through those <unk>
And he said, "No, unless you be someone important, you have a very good thing, you can't actually do it.
These devices are not affordable for people."
And I said, "Well, how do you communicate then?"
Somebody to see the movie "The <unk> and the <unk>
They communicate in that way, they're going to engage with your finger.
I said, "That's <unk> How can it be?"
So I presented me with the only desire to deliver a check and instead signed a check that I didn't have the least idea how I was going to <unk>
I had her brother with her brother and her father there at that particular time, "All right, this is the Tony <unk> I'm going to talk about -- we're going to build a machine, and we're going to find a way to make your art again.
Because it's ridiculous that somebody who have so much in your interior cannot be able to <unk>
So I spoke to a conference a couple of months later.
I met these guys called <unk> <unk> Research Research -- that have a technology that allows them to project a light on any surface and then, with a laser laser. drawn on that and record the negative space.
So they go around making art facilities like this.
All the things that <unk> they say, are part of a cycle of life.
They start with sex organs, then with the bad words, then with the Bush attacks, and at the end, people start doing art.
But there was always a life cycle in their <unk>
And so it started the journey.
And about two years later, about a year later, after a lot of organization and a lot of moving things on one side we had achieved a couple of things.
One, you touch the gates of the insurance companies and we get a machine so that you could put it into a machine like Stephen <unk>
Which was great.
And seriously, is the most <unk> I call it <unk> because when I talk to the guy you get an email from him, and you say, "Don't <unk> This guy is <unk>
The other thing that we did was to bring seven programmers from all the world to <unk> all the corner of all the corners of the <unk> to our house.
My wife, the kids and I, we moved to the garage and these hackers and programmers and programmers and <unk> and <unk> took control of the house.
Many of our friends thought that we did something totally stupid and when they were <unk> they would have taken off the frames of the walls and instead they would have <unk>
But for two weeks, we went to the <unk> <unk> my son was part of my child as well, and we created this.
It's called <unk> and you can see the <unk>
They are a pair of cheap sun glasses that we bought in the <unk> <unk> and Beach, something of copper wire and <unk> <unk> and Radio <unk>
We took a camera <unk> the <unk> we put it on a light of LED light, and now there's a device that is free -- and you build one -- we release the code -- we release the software, the software is <unk> for free.
And we created a device that has no limitation at all.
There's no insurance company to say "No."
There is no hospital that can say "No."
Any person with paralysis today has access to drawing and communicate using just your eyes.
Thank you.
Thank you very much for you. That was awesome.
So at the end of the two weeks, we went back to the <unk> room.
I love this picture because this is the other person in the other person, and that's his room.
There was all this <unk> and <unk> during the great opening.
And after a year of planning, two weeks of learning that I all night, Tony came back to drawing for the first time in seven years.
And this is a wonderful picture because this is the support system of his life, and it's looking through the support system.
We ran out the bed so I could see.
And we put a projector on a wall of the parking lot from the hospital.
And he came back to drawing for his family and friends and friends -- and you can imagine, what the feeling was in the parking lot.
The funny thing was that we had to take on the parking lot, so we feel like we were <unk> graffiti as well.
And at the end of this, he sent us an email and this was what he said, "This was the first time I drew in seven years.
I felt like it would have been under the water and somebody finally came to <unk> and they would get me out of there so that I could <unk>
It's not <unk>
In a way, that's our <unk>
That's what keeps us in motion, <unk>
And we have a long way to go through this.
This is a cool device, but it's the equivalent of a fan, <unk>
Someone with this artistic potential deserves a lot more.
That's why we're trying to figure out how to make it faster and so robust.
Since then, we've had all kinds of recognition.
We've won a lot of awards.
Remember, it's <unk> none of us are making money with this.
It all comes out of our own pockets.
The prizes were <unk> "Oh, this is <unk>
Armstrong <unk> something about us, and then, in December, Time magazine recognized us as one of the 50 best inventions of 2010, and it was really cool.
The best thing about this -- and this is what ends up close the <unk> is that in April, this year in the <unk> <unk> in the middle of Los Angeles is going to be an exhibition called <unk> in <unk>
And <unk> in <unk> is going to have the best <unk> of urban art, <unk> <unk> <unk> all of them are going to be there.
<unk> is going to be on the show which is pretty impressive.
So basically this is my idea: if you see something that is not possible, do it possible.
None of what there is in this room was possible -- the stage, the computer, the microphone, the <unk> nothing was possible at a certain time.
Make it <unk> anything from this room.
I'm not a programmer, I never did anything with technological recognition technology, I just recognized something and I was obsessed with wonderful people to be able to make it happen.
And these are the questions that I want all of us to do every day when we find ourselves with something that we feel like to do. If it's not now, <unk> And if I am not me, who is <unk>
Thank you guys.
I've spent the last few years in situations that are often very difficult and at the same time as dangerous as well.
I went to the hard <unk>
I worked in a dangerous <unk> mine.
<unk> in <unk> difficult and dangerous.
And I spent 30 days of eating just this funny thing, at first, something difficult in the middle, very dangerous at the end.
In fact, in a large part of my career I've been involved in situations in horrible appearance with the only goal to treat. And to look at social issues in ways that are <unk> interesting, and hopefully analyzing them in a way that they look at and accessible to the audience.
So when I knew I was going to come here to do a TEDTalk on the world of brands and the <unk> I wanted to do something a little bit different.
So some of them may have heard or not, a couple of weeks ago I took a <unk> <unk>
I sent some messages on Facebook, some of Twitter on Twitter, I offered the name of my TED TEDTalk from 2011.
What had been the following: <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> my TEDTalk that you have no idea what it is and according to content might be <unk> in the face, especially if I put it in ridiculous -- you either put it on your <unk> or your company to do it.
But I said that, it's a very good opportunity to do.
Do you know how many people look at these <unk>
<unk>
It's a degree in progress, by the way.
So even with that <unk> I knew somebody was going to buy the <unk>
If you had asked me a year ago, I couldn't have been able to do it for certain.
But in the new film that I'm working on, we looked at the <unk> world of advertising.
And as I said before, I've been involved in horrible situations in the last few years, but nothing could be able to do it for something so difficult or dangerous to go into the rooms with these guys.
You see, I had this idea for a movie.
Morgan <unk> I want to make a film that is about the <unk> of products and marketing and advertising, and that the film was <unk> with <unk> marketing and advertising.
The film is going to call the biggest film <unk>
What happens in "The biggest movie ever <unk> is that everything up to the bottom, actually has a computer imaging all the time; from the <unk> that appears before the title, the X-ray brand.
Now this brand, <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
These people were <unk> in the film to <unk> forever.
And so the film is exploring all this idea -- <unk> <unk> is what? It's <unk> It's <unk> <unk> <unk>
I am a <unk> <unk> <unk> just <unk> It was more <unk>
He was <unk> <unk>
But we're not just going to have the sponsor of the brand in the title but we're going to make sure we <unk> all the categories that we can in the film.
Maybe we <unk> a shoe and it becomes the most cool shoe you have.
The biggest car you put on the largest film you ever had, the best of you have been <unk> <unk> from "The biggest film <unk>
<unk> <unk> The idea is then also going to show the brands as part of life, to make them <unk> the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> the <unk> MS: And we actually show the whole process of how it works.
The <unk> goal is transparency.
You're going to see all the process in this movie.
That's the full idea, the whole shot of beginning to end.
And I would love to help you help make it happen.
Robert <unk> You know, it's funny because it's the first time I hear that; it's the most respect for the audience.
<unk> However, I don't know how <unk> people are going to be.
<unk> Do you have a <unk> -- I don't know if you're very <unk> but you know how it goes to <unk> <unk> Don't <unk> David <unk> How much money do you need to do this?
MS: A half and a half and a half million -- <unk> -- John <unk> I think it's going to be hard to meet them, but it's certainly going to be worth a couple of big brands to convince you.
<unk> Who knows, maybe for the moment that the movie is going to look like a lot of <unk> <unk>
MS: What do you think is going to be the answer?
Stuart <unk> Most of the answers will be there.
MS: But it's going to be hard to <unk> the film or to be I?
JK: Both of them.
MS: This means you're not very optimistic.
So, <unk> I need help.
MK: I can help.
MS: All right. <unk> <unk> Awesome.
MK: We need to think about what brands.
MS: Yeah. <unk> That's the <unk> When you look at the people you have to be <unk>
MK: We have some places where to go. <unk> <unk> the camera.
MS: I thought that <unk> <unk> meant we have a conversation outside the microphone.
<unk> the camera means "We don't want to know anything about your <unk>
MS: And so it was, one by one, all these companies were suddenly gone.
No one wanted to have anything to do with this film.
I was surprised.
They didn't want to know about this project.
And I was very <unk> I thought the concept of advertising, it was to present the product as many people as possible, and so that as many people would see it as possible.
Especially in the world today about this intersection of new media and old media and the <unk> media scenario is not the idea to tell that new vehicle that is going to bring the message to the <unk>
No, that's what I thought.
But the problem was, you see, my idea had a mistake <unk> and that mistake was this.
Actually, no, there was no such mistake.
There was no error at all.
This would have been fine.
But the problem was what this image.
See, when you look for images of <unk> on Google <unk>   This is one of the first images that were introduced.
I like your <unk> Sergey <unk> No.
This was the problem: <unk> free simulation or <unk> easily detected or <unk> easily <unk> which is characterized by zero information, especially in the practices of <unk> being the last line perhaps the biggest problem.
You see, we hear a lot about transparency in these days.
Our politicians <unk> President <unk> even <unk>
But suddenly when it comes to make it really changes suddenly.
But why? Well, transparency gives <unk> -- like that weird bear that still keeps <unk>
It's <unk>   Like this <unk>
And it's also very risky.
What else is it <unk>
<unk> a <unk> <unk> <unk>
That's very risky.
When I started talking to companies and to tell you that we wanted to tell this story and they said, "No, we want you to <unk> <unk> history.
We want you to make a story, but you know, <unk> story."
See, when I was a kid, and my father would get me to lie on some lie -- and that's him looking at it, as he used to say, <unk> there are three sides in every story.
It's your story, it's my story, and it's the story <unk>
As you can see, in this film we wanted to tell the real story.
But with only one company, a agency wanting to help me -- and that just because I knew John Bond and Richard <unk> from many years -- I realized I would have to go on my own, I would have to take out of the presence and go to business myself with all my team.
So what I started to figure out all of a sudden -- and I started giving me up, is that when you start talking to the companies the idea of understanding your brand is a universal problem.
MS: I have friends who make big films -- big, giant movies and others who make small, independent movies like mine.
And my friends who make a big Hollywood movies say that the reason their movies are so successful is because of the brands associated with the brands that they have.
And then my friends who make independent films say, "Well, how are we supposed to compete with these big, giant movies of <unk>
And the film is called "The largest movie ever <unk>
How are we going to see specifically <unk> in the film?
Every time I am to go out, every time I open my <unk> you'll see the <unk> <unk>
At any time during an interview with somebody else can say, "Are you cool for this <unk>
You're ready? You see a little nervous.
I want to help you to help you.
Maybe you should put a little bit of this before the <unk>
And there's one of these <unk> <unk>
<unk> <unk> like <unk> of the <unk> are going to have their chance.
We're going to have a little bit for man like <unk> solid, to <unk> in bar, like it.
That's the general story.
Now I can answer your questions and give you a look at it.
Karen Frank: We're a small brand.
<unk> the kind of smaller movies that we have -- we are rather <unk>
So we don't have the budget that has other brands.
So doing things like this, you know, remind people of the reason why this interests us.
MS: What words would you use to describe <unk>
<unk> is in white.
<unk> That's a big question.
Woman:
MS: Technology is not the way you want to describe something that you put in the <unk>
Man: We talk about something new.
I think <unk> is a great word that actually puts this category in positive versus <unk> smell and <unk>
It keeps you.
How do you keep you cool longer, with better <unk> three times <unk>
Things like those who were <unk>
MS: And that's a <unk> company.
What about me? What about a common kind of <unk>
I need to talk to the man in the street, people like me, to the common <unk>
They have to tell me about my brand.
MS: How do you define your <unk>
Man: <unk> my <unk>
I don't know.
I like the <unk>
Woman: revive the '80s, <unk> <unk> unless it's day of <unk>
MS: All right, what is the brand <unk>
<unk> A number of <unk> <unk> Man: I guess the kind of gender, the style I have to be like a <unk> <unk>
I like the dark colors -- a lot of gray colors and things like that.
Usually I've been exposed to, and I like the <unk> and I like the <unk> <unk>
Woman: If Dan was a brand <unk> it could be a <unk> <unk> <unk>
Man 2: The brand I am, I would call it <unk> <unk>
Woman #2: Part of a <unk> part of <unk> <unk> I don't know.
Man 3: I'm the kind of pet pet guy.
They <unk> toys for pets in the country and in the world.
So I guess that's my brand.
In my little sector, that's my brand.
Man 4: My brand is caused because he was <unk>
Man 5: <unk> <unk> failure.
Is that something?
<unk> I'm <unk>
<unk> I'm <unk>
MS: Well, not all of us can be made Tom, but I often lie on the intersection of <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk>
I realized I needed an expert.
I needed somebody who could get into my head, somebody who could help me understand what they call the <unk> <unk>
And I found a company called <unk> <unk> in Pittsburgh.
They helped us companies like <unk> <unk> <unk> to discover that <unk> personality.
If they could do it for them, they could surely do it for me.
<unk> <unk> the pictures, right?
MS: Yeah. The first picture is a family picture.
AT: Tell me a little bit about how you relate to your thoughts and feelings your way of self.
MS: These people shape my way to see the world.
AT: Tell me about that world.
MS: That world? I think your world is the world in which you are going to look like that, like the people around you, your friends, the way you live your life, the work you do.
All those things come from and start in a place and in my case come from and start in my family, in West Virginia.
AT: What's the next one you want to talk about.
MS: The next is "This was the best day of my life."
AT: How do you relate to your thoughts, feelings and your way to be?
MS: It's like who I'd like to be me.
I like different things.
I like weird things. I like weird things.
AT: Tell me about <unk> to what do we do that?
What is the <unk> What phase is it now?
Why is it important to <unk> What is the <unk>
Tell me a little bit about that.
It's a little bit more about you, which is not who you are.
What other <unk> have you <unk>
You don't have to be afraid of, what kind of Russian mountain are you?
MS: <unk> <unk> Thank you.)
AT: Thank you for your patience. You would say, <unk> Yes. <unk> Thank you very much.) All right.
MS: Yes, I don't know what's going to go out of this.
There was a lot of madness to do this.
<unk> <unk> The first thing I saw was this idea that there are two different sides -- but <unk> in your personality -- the Morgan Morgan <unk> is a <unk> brand.
They were <unk> very well together.
And I think there's almost a paradox in them.
And I think some companies just get into one of their strong points or the other instead of focusing on both.
A lot of companies tend to be the <unk> nature to avoid the things that are not <unk> to avoid fear of fear, and you actually <unk> and you make that become positive for you, and it's nice to see that.
What other brands are they?
The first here is Apple.
And you can also see here at <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk>
Now there are <unk> marks and conscious brands -- those things that have gone and come up, but a <unk> brand is something quite powerful.
MS: A brand <unk> What's your <unk>
If somebody asks you to <unk> your brand, your brand, and what would that be?
You're a <unk> attribute you're somebody who makes your blood <unk>
Or are you rather <unk>
slightly more <unk> <unk> <unk>
The <unk> attributes are like being playful to be fresh as the <unk> contemporary <unk> <unk> <unk> or bold like <unk> <unk> quickly or <unk> <unk> magical -- magical or mystic as <unk>
Or are you rather than attribute <unk>
You're <unk> sophisticated as <unk>
You're <unk> traditional <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
You're a stable question, a family <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> or wise people like the Dalai Lama or <unk>
Over the course of this film we had over 500 companies, <unk> and <unk> who said, <unk> they didn't want to be part of this project.
They didn't want to have anything to do with this film, mostly because they wouldn't have control, they wouldn't have control over the end product.
They allowed us to tell the story of the <unk> and we came to tell the story in this film of how now I can use MRI centers to identify the centers of the desire that was both commercial marketing as a movie for movies.
We went to San Paulo where they have forbidden advertising in the open.
In the entire city for the last five years, there's no <unk> there's no <unk> there's no <unk>
And we went to school districts where companies are getting on the way in schools with money problems in the U.S.
The incredible thing for me is that the projects that I've had the biggest answer or the ones that I've been more successful is those in which I've interacted with things directly.
And that's what these brands.
They took the <unk> they took off their agencies, and they said, maybe these agencies don't have my best interest in mind.
I'm going to deal with the artist.
I'm going to work with him to create something different, something that is going to make people think about people, who is going to challenge the way we look at the world.
And how has it gone? They did succeed?
Well, since the movie came out, in the <unk> Festival let's take a look.
According to <unk> the film came out, in January, and since then -- and this is not <unk> we've had 900 million species of media to this film.
This covers just a couple of weeks and a half.
That's just in <unk> and no press, and TV.
The film is not <unk>
It's still not online. It's not in <unk>
It's not even presented in other countries yet.
Ultimately, this film has already started to gain momentum.
And it's not bad at almost all the agencies that we talk about to talk about their customers not to be part.
I've always believed that if you take risks, if you take risks, you have opportunities.
I think when you get out of that people are pushing the failure.
I think when you train their employees in loss at risk is preparing all of your company for <unk>
I feel that what it has to happen to happen is that we have to encourage people to <unk>
We need to animate people that are not afraid of opportunities that can be <unk>
Ultimately, we'll move forward, I think we need to give it to the fear.
We need to put that bear in a cage.
<unk> fear. <unk>
From a <unk> at the time, we have to embrace the risk.
And ultimately, we have to support transparency.
Now, more than a little bit of honesty is going to go a long way.
And I said that, with honesty and transparency, all of my talk <unk> the <unk> has been presented by my good friends of <unk> who <unk> bought the rights of the name in <unk>
<unk> <unk> big data in big opportunities for companies around the world.
<unk> presents the <unk>
Thank you very much people.
June Cohen: So, <unk> in behalf of transparency, which happened exactly with those <unk>
MS: It's a fantastic question.
In my pocket I have a check at the name of the TED organization, the Foundation Foundation a check for <unk> to be applied to my attendance for TED <unk>
The idea behind the <unk> <unk> <unk> is actually very simple.
We don't want Iran to get the nuclear bomb.
Their biggest asset to develop nuclear weapons is the <unk> plant.
The gray boxes you see are control systems in real time.
If we were able to compromise these systems that control speeds and <unk> we can cause a lot of problems with <unk>
The gray boxes don't use <unk> software are a completely different technology.
But if we were able to put a cash virus from Windows in a portable computer that is used by an engineer to set up this gray, then we're ready.
This is the plan behind <unk>
So we started with a paper <unk>
The <unk> enter the gray box -- <unk> <unk> and the Iranian nuclear program is <unk> <unk> mission.
It's easy, <unk>
I want to tell you how we discovered this.
When we began to investigate <unk> about six months ago, the purpose was completely unknown.
The only thing I knew is that it's very, very complex at the part of the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
It seemed like I want to do something with these technological boxes, these control systems.
That struck us attention, and we started an experiment in which we would <unk> our environment with <unk> and we saw what was going on with this.
So they got very strange things.
<unk> <unk> like a lab rat in which we didn't like our <unk> the wave, but I didn't want to eat.
I had no sense for me.
And after experiment with different flavors of cheese, I realized, and I thought, this is a <unk> attack.
It's completely <unk>
The <unk> is actively searching in the gray box if it finds a specific configuration and even if the program that is trying to infect is actually working on that <unk>
If not, we don't do anything.
So that called my attention, and we started working on this almost 24 hours a day, because we don't know what the <unk> is.
It might be -- let's say for example, an American energy plant, or a chemical plant in Germany.
Better to make the goal soon.
And so we extracted and <unk> the attack, and we found that it was <unk> in two pumps -- a small and a big one.
We also saw that they were very professionally very professionally people who obviously had all the internal information.
It would be all the points that they attack.
You probably even know how much <unk> the operator.
So you know everything.
And if you've heard that <unk> <unk> is complex and high-tech <unk> let me tell you -- the load is very complex.
It's very above everything we've seen before.
Here you see this code of the attack.
We're talking about 15 lines of code.
It looks like the old <unk> language.
I want to tell you how we could find sense to this code.
What we were looking at first were called the systems of the system, because we know what they do.
Then we were looking at <unk> and data structures and we were trying to spread it with the real world, with potential targets of the world.
We need theories about recipients that we can pass or <unk>
To get to theories about goals, we remember that it's definitely a violent <unk> it must be a <unk> <unk> and it's surely sitting in Iran, because it's where most infections has been <unk>
There are no thousands of targets in that area.
It basically boils down to the nuclear power plant of <unk> and the <unk> plant.
So I told my <unk> <unk> a list of all the experts in <unk> and energy plants between our <unk>
I called them and I asked them in an effort for <unk> their experience with what we found in code and data.
And it worked pretty well.
So we were able to associate the little digital <unk> with control of the <unk>
The rotor is that a mobile piece within the <unk> that black object you see.
If they run the speed of this <unk> they certainly can <unk> and even making the <unk> <unk>
What we also saw is that the attack of the attack was to make it slow and <unk> in an effort to go back to the nest engineers so that they couldn't solve this very quickly.
We try to figure out the big digital <unk> looking very close to the data and its structures.
So for example, the number <unk> shows up in that code, you can't afford it.
I started research in scientific literature about how these <unk> are built in <unk> and found that they're <unk> in what is called a <unk> and every waterfall contains <unk>
That made sense, there was a coincidence.
And it got better yet.
These <unk> in Iran are <unk> in 15 pieces of so-called stages.
And guess what we found in the <unk> code.
A almost <unk> structure.
So again, that was a good coincidence.
This gave us a lot of confidence in understanding what we had in my hands.
So it's not <unk> it wasn't like this.
The results have been coming down after several weeks of hard work.
<unk> <unk> in dead ends.
And yet, we found that both digital <unk> would say to one and very goal, but from different <unk>
The little <unk> is taking a <unk> and making the <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> is communicating with six <unk> and manipulating <unk>
In <unk> we are very confident that we've determined what the <unk> is.
It's <unk> and it's just <unk>
We don't have to worry that other goals are <unk> by <unk>
So here I show you some very interesting things that we just looked at -- I really <unk>
There is the gray box, and you see the <unk>
What this thing does is <unk> the input values from the sensors for example, of pressure sensors and the vibration sensors and provide <unk> <unk> which is still running during the attack, with false data.
And believe it or not, these <unk> data is <unk> by <unk>
It's like in the Hollywood movies where, during the <unk> the security camera is fed up <unk>
It's cool <unk>
The idea here is obviously not only just <unk> the operators in the fourth control.
It's really much more dangerous and <unk>
The idea is <unk> a digital security.
We need digital security systems where a human operator could not act fast.
For example, in an energy plant, when the big steam turbine goes out of speed, you have to open up <unk> valves in a <unk>
Obviously, this can't make a human operator, right?
That's where we need digital security.
And when they're <unk> then they can spend bad things.
The plant can blow up.
And not the <unk> or the security system is <unk>
That scares me.
But it can be worse.
What I'm going to say is very important.
Think about this. This attack is <unk>
It has nothing to see, specifically with <unk> with <unk> <unk>
It could work too, for example, in an energy plant, or in a <unk> factory.
It's <unk>
And you don't have <unk> <unk> that disseminate this burden with a <unk> key as we saw in the case of <unk>
You could also use conventional technology of worms for <unk>
<unk> as possible.
And if we made that, with what we <unk> is with a <unk> of mass destruction.
That's the consequence that we need to face.
Unfortunately, the biggest number of targets for such attacks is not in the Middle East.
It's in the United States and in Japan.
All the green areas are very much spaces with great goals.
We have to face the consequences and better than we're going to start preparing now.
Thank you.
Chris Anderson: I have a question.
<unk> has been done in many sides that people assume that the <unk> is the main entity behind this.
What's your <unk>
Ralph <unk> Okay, you really want to hear this?
Yeah. <unk>
My view is that the <unk> is involved but the engine is not <unk>
The engine behind this is the superpower <unk>
There's one alone, and that's the United States, fortunately, <unk>
Because, in another way, our problems would be even larger.
CA: Thank you for <unk> Thank you, <unk>
I want you to imagine a robot that can be able to take and give it a <unk> skills or another to make the chairs of chairs.
In <unk> <unk> we call these robots, <unk>
They are nothing different than something that you put in the morning, gives you a big force that you also increases its speed, and it helps him to handle the balance.
It's actually the real integration of man and the machine.
But not just that -- it can integrate it and connecting with the universe and with other kinds of things.
This is not a <unk> idea.
To show you now what we're working on, we started talking about the American soldier who, on average, and it should take on top of their back a load of pounds, and it's being made up to get even more equipment.
Obviously, this leads to some important complications -- injuries in the back 30 percent of the soldiers -- with <unk> <unk> on the back.
We decided to look at this challenge and create an exoskeleton that could help handle the matter.
Let me introduce you to the <unk> or <unk> <unk>
Soldier: With the exoskeleton <unk> I can give you 90 pounds for three variables for a lot of hours.
Their flexible design allows you to put in <unk> <unk> and run with great <unk>
<unk> what I want to do, or where I want to go, and then it increases my strength and my resistance.
<unk> <unk> We're ready, with our industrial partner to produce this device, this new <unk> this year.
I mean, it's a reality.
Let's go back to the <unk> users of wheels, about what I'm particularly passionate about.
There are 68 million people in chairs of wheels, all over the world.
Like one percent of the total population.
And this is a really conservative.
We talk about something that happens very often, people with damage in the column that when they start their life -- to the 20, 30 or 40 years -- collide against a wall and the wheelchair turns out to be their only choice.
We also talk about the population that goes together as quickly.
His only option, many times -- for a brain injury or some other twist -- is the wheelchair.
And this has been that for the last 500 years, from his successful <unk> as I must recognize.
So we decided to start by writing a new chapter about mobility.
Let me introduce you to the <unk> which is using Amanda <unk> who was 19 years ago who had a <unk> column and as a result couldn't be able to go back to 19 years, until now.
Amanda <unk> Thank you.
EB: Amanda is using our <unk> that <unk>
It's got a few sensors ...
It's completely not <unk> in the crutches that they send signals on board on board on the back.
There are some batteries that give the engines in the <unk> and the knees, and they do it with this soft and very natural <unk>
AB: I was 24 in the top of my life when, for a strange leap in the air, over the air, it was <unk>
In a fraction of a second, I lost a sense of feeling and all the motion from <unk> down.
Shortly after that, a doctor walked into my hospital in the hospital, and he said, "You will never go back to <unk>
That happened 19 years ago.
So I stole to the last bit of hope of my being.
The technology of adaptation since then, has allowed me to learn to <unk> it costs to <unk> it costs the rocks and even set up on a bike bicycle.
But they have not invented anything that allowed me to walk, so far.
Thank you.
EB: As you can see, we have the technology, we have the platforms to sit and talk to you.
It's in our hands, and we have all the potential here to change life to future generations -- not just soldiers, but to Amanda, and to all the chairs of wheels, all of the chairs in the wheels, all of them.
AB: Thank you.
I just came back from a community that has the secret of human survival.
It's a place where women have the <unk> practice sex to say hello, and the game is the order of the day -- where fun is serious.
And no, it's not the <unk> Man Man or San Francisco.
Ladies and gentlemen, you know its cousins.
This is the world of the temperate Bonobos in the temperate of Congo.
The bonobos are, along with chimpanzees, their closest life.
That means that we all share a common ancestry -- an evolutionary grandmother, which lived about six million years ago.
Now, the chimps are known for their <unk>
But unfortunately, we've done a lot of emphasis on this aspect in our narratives of human evolution.
But the bonobos show us the other side of the coin.
Whereas the chimps are dominated by large, <unk> society is in charge of females with power.
These guys have created something special because this leads to a very tolerant society, where death is still not <unk>
But unfortunately, the bonobos are the least <unk> of the big apes.
They live in the depths of the forest <unk> and it has been very difficult to <unk>
The Congo is a <unk> land of extraordinary biodiversity and beauty, but also the heart of the <unk> <unk> scenario that has been used for decades and caused almost as many deaths like the First World War.
No wonder that this destruction also put in danger to the survival of the Bonobo.
The trade of hunting and deforestation do not fill in a stadium with the Bonobos that stay in the world -- and honestly, we're not sure about it.
However, in this land of violence and chaos -- you can hear laughter hidden <unk> the trees.
Who are these <unk>
We know them as the apes <unk> the love, not <unk> because they have sex and <unk> <unk> and <unk> to handle conflicts and solve social problems.
I'm not saying that this is the solution to all of the problems of humanity because the life of Bonobos is more than <unk> <unk>
To <unk> like humans, they love to play throughout their lifetime.
Play isn't just a children's game.
For us and for them the game is fundamental to establish links and foster <unk>
With him we learn to <unk> and we learn the rules of play.
The game increases creativity and resilience and it has to do with <unk> diversity of interactions, diversity of behaviors, diversity of connections.
And when you look at the play, Bonobo sees the roots of the same of the laughter, the dance and the human ritual and the human.
The game is the glue that comes together.
I don't know how you play -- but I want to show you a couple of unique <unk> videos from the wild.
First, it's a <unk> <unk> game, and I don't talk about football.
Here we have a female and a young male in the middle of a <unk>
Look at what's doing it.
It could be the evolutionary origin of the phrase, <unk> <unk>
I just believe in this case, he loves him, right?
Yeah.
So the sexual game is so common in Bonobos as a humans.
And this video is really interesting because I think -- this video is really interesting because it shows the invention of unusual elements to the game -- like <unk> and also how the game requires confidence and <unk> and <unk> and at the same time is the most fun.
But the game is <unk>
The game is <unk> it can take a lot of ways, some of which are more <unk> <unk> <unk> maybe the place where the wonder.
And I want you to <unk> this is <unk> a young female who's playing with water <unk>
I think, as we sometimes play ourselves, and we explore the boundaries of our inner worlds and outside.
And it's that playful curiosity that drives us to explore, to interact. And then the unexpected connections that we form are the real <unk> of creativity.
These are just small samples of understanding that Bonobos give us our past and present.
But they also have a secret for our future, a future where we need to adapt to a more and more difficult world with greater creativity and more cooperation.
The secret is that play is the key to these capabilities.
In other words, the game is our <unk> <unk>
To adapt to a world that changes we need to play.
But let's go through the maximum ability to game?
The game is not <unk>
The game is essential.
To Bonobos and human beings, life is not just cruel and <unk>
When it looks at least appropriate play, it can be the moments when it's the most <unk>
So <unk> <unk> to accept this gift of evolution and play together while they <unk> creativity, friendship and wonder.
Thank you.
In New York I'm responsible for development of a nonprofit organization called Robin <unk>
When I'm not fighting poverty, <unk> fires like a captain of captain in a fire <unk>
And in our city, where the volunteers rely on a highly skilled staff. You have to get to the fire site very soon to get into action.
I remember my first fire.
I was the second volunteer on the site, so I had a pretty high probability of going.
But there was a race to foot against the other volunteers to get to the captain in charge and find out what our task was.
When I found the <unk> I was <unk> in a conversation with the owner that certainly passed one of the worst days of his life.
We were in complete night, she was standing outside in the rain, under a <unk> in her face, and she was <unk> while his house was on fire.
The other volunteer that I had just arrived before me, <unk> <unk> <unk> --  came first to the captain and he asked him to come up and save the dog in your house.
<unk> I was <unk> <unk>
There was a lawyer or a <unk> of money that, during the rest of his life, I would have to tell the people who walked into a burning building to save a live room just because I won for five seconds.
Well, I was the following.
The captain made me a <unk>
He said, <unk> I need for the house.
I need you to <unk> <unk> the fire, and he brings this woman a couple of shoes in.
I <unk>
It wasn't exactly what I expected but <unk> I got the stairs, at the end of the hall, I went to the fire firemen -- that at that height or less they had ended up off the fire and walked into the fourth one in search of a pair of shoes.
I know what you're thinking, but I'm not a hero.
I took my burden back through the ladder where I met my <unk> and the beautiful dog on the front door.
<unk> from the house of the house <unk> where, as you would expect, her trove of a lot more attention than mine.
A few weeks later that the department got a letter from the owner of the house <unk> by the brave effort to save his house.
The kindness that she noticed over the other was that somebody had reached even a pair of shoes.
Both in my calling in Robin <unk> as in my calling as fireman acts of generosity and kindness in a <unk> scale, but also of acts of grace and courage to individual level.
And you know what I've learned?
Everything has its importance.
So when I look at this room to people who have made it, or are they going to be <unk> remarkable levels of success I'd like to remind you this: You don't know wait.
Don't wait to win the first million to make a difference in somebody's life.
If you have something to give, you get it now.
<unk> food in a dining room.
It's mentors.
Not every day we're going to have a chance to save someone's life, but every day we're going to influence somebody's life.
So I trained the <unk>
Thank you.
Bruno Giussani: Mark, Mark, comes back.
Mark <unk> Thank you.
This may seem strange, but I'm a big fan of the concrete block there.
The first concrete blocks are built in <unk> with a very simple idea of cement from a fixed measure that fit between each other.
Very quickly, these became the most rapidly building unit in the world.
They have allowed us to build things larger than us, like buildings or bridges like this.
Essentially, these blocks have become the pillars of our time.
Almost a hundred years later, in 1947, to <unk> came up with this.
It was called <unk> brick <unk>
And in a few years, the <unk> brick came to every home.
It's been estimated that they've been made over 400 billion or 75 bricks per person on the planet.
You don't have to be an engineer to build <unk>
<unk> made it accessible.
<unk> simply adopted the concrete block in the world, and it turned it into a fundamental piece of our imagination.
Meanwhile, exactly that same year, in the Bell labs the next revolution was about to <unk> the new building block.
The transistor was a small piece of plastic that would take us from a <unk> set of brick around a world where everything was interactive.
Just like the concrete block that the transistor allows to create much bigger and more complex, a brick at once.
But there's a <unk> difference, the transistor was just for experts.
I personally don't know that the building blocks of our time are being reserved at experts, so I decided to change it.
Eight years ago, when I was at the Media Lab, I started to explore the idea of bringing the power of engineers to the hands of artists and designers.
A few years ago, I started developing <unk>
I'm going to show you how they work.
<unk> are electronic modules each with a specific function.
They're <unk> to be light, sound, motors and sensors.
And the best thing about everything is that they join these magnets together.
So you can't place it in a wrong way.
<unk> have a colored code.
The green is the <unk> the blue is the stream, the pink is the input and the orange one, it's the wire.
So you just put together a blue one, and you can very quickly start to make bigger circuits in the place.
A green blue one is producing light.
Can we put a button in the middle, and we have a <unk>
If we change the button by a pulse, that's here, and now we have a <unk> light.
This <unk> this <unk> to create more impact and we have a noise.
I'm going to stop this.
So beyond the simple game, <unk> are actually very powerful.
Instead of having to program, connecting and <unk> <unk> it allows us to program using very simple <unk>
To make it faster or slower or slower and just spin this button that makes the pulse faster or slower.
The idea behind <unk> is that it's a growing collection up.
We want all of the interactions in the world to go into brick ready to use.
<unk> sound, solar cells, <unk> everything must be accessible.
We have given the kids to see them playing with them.
And it's been an incredible experience.
The best thing is how they start understanding the electronics of every day that you don't learn in schools.
For example, how does a light in night, or why the door of an elevator gets open, or how an iPod responds to touch.
We've also led to design schools.
So for example, designers had no experience in electronics begin to play with <unk> like a material.
Here you can see, with paper bottles and <unk> we have <unk> <unk>
<unk>  A few weeks ago, we took <unk> to the American Rhode Island School of Rhode Island, who have no experience in engineering, just in golf and wood and paper and said, Make something.
Here's an example of a project that has done a <unk> barrel in motion.
But wait, here comes my favorite project.
It's a <unk> <unk> <unk> which is a fear of darkness.
For these not engineers, <unk> became another material, electronics became another material.
And we want this material to be aware of everyone.
So <unk> has open source.
You can visit the website, download all the records of design and <unk>
We want to encourage a world of creators, inventors and collaborators because this world we live, this interactive world is ours.
So I'll go ahead and make things.
Thank you.
I'm going to talk about unexpected discoveries.
I work in the solar technology.
And my little company is looking for getting involved in the environment focusing on the environment.
It's distributed collaboration.
This is a little video of what we do.
<unk> Wait for a moment.
You can take a little bit of <unk>
We can continue to better leave the video on one side.
No.
This is not ...
All right.
The solar technology is ...
Oh, I just think of time?
All right. Thank you very much.
A couple of years ago I launched an initiative to recruit the best designers and technical people to take a year and work in a environment that represents almost everything that is supposed to work on the government.
The initiative was called <unk> for <unk> and it would be like <unk> <unk> to <unk>
And we had a few members every year, and we put them to work with the <unk>
Instead of giving them to the Third World we send them to the wild world.
They made big <unk> worked with the employees of <unk>
Their task is to show the possibilities of current technology.
<unk> <unk>
This is a fall of the city in Boston.
So here it appears as if I would look at a date, but what it really looks for is that somebody will get it when it gets caught by snow because he knows it's not very good at turning fires when it's covered by a meter of snow.
How did it come to help the help of this <unk>
Last year in Boston we had a team of members of <unk> for <unk>
They were there in February and at that moment -- I would have a long last year.
They realized that the city never wiped out these <unk>
But one of the members called Erik <unk> I noticed something else -- that citizens <unk> with <unk> sidewalks right in front of them.
So he did like any good programmer, and I developed an app.
It's a nice application where you can take a <unk>
You keep <unk> when you <unk>
When you do that, you put a name, in this case, put it up.
If you don't do, someone can <unk>
I mean, it has a statistical component of it.
It's a pretty spectacular application.
Maybe it's the smallest applications in the 21st apps last year.
But it does something that no other technology of the government <unk>
And it spreads into viral ways.
A responsible system of <unk> City to see this app realized that he could use it, not to the snow, but for citizens to get <unk>
It's very important that they work these <unk> from tsunami, but people <unk> the batteries.
That's why they ask citizens to <unk>
And then Seattle decided to use it to make citizens <unk> the <unk> <unk>
And Chicago just <unk> to make people <unk> to clean sidewalks when they were <unk>
So now we know nine cities that we have to use it.
And this has been <unk> and <unk> in a natural way.
If you know a little bit of government technology, you know that this is not going on.
The acquisition of software usually takes a couple of years.
Last year in Boston we had a team working on a project that took three people for two and a half months.
It was a tool that parents could choose the best public school for their children.
Then we told us that they had done by the normal channels would have taken at least two and two million dollars.
And that's not nothing.
Now there's a project in the California judicial power that until the time, 2,000 billion dollars and it doesn't work.
And there are projects like this in every level of government.
So an app that comes in a couple of days and it spreads in a viral form is kind of kind of kind of a shot of warning to the institution of government.
It suggests to the government better ways to work, not as private companies like a lot of people think it should be.
Not as a technological company, but rather like the Internet.
I mean, without <unk> in a form and <unk>
And that's important.
But the most important thing about this app is that it represents the way to address the matter of the government that has the new <unk> not as a problem of an institution, but as a problem of collective action.
And that's very good because it turns out we're really good for the collective action with digital technology.
And there is a very large community of people who are building the tools for them to engage together with efficacy.
And it's not just <unk> for <unk> but there are hundreds of people all over the country that contribute to <unk> apps every day in their own communities.
They haven't given the government.
They feel a great frustration in front of it, but they don't get it out of it.
And these people know something we've lost in sight.
And that is that if we leave the feelings about politics, the line in the <unk> <unk> <unk> and all those other things that give us crazy -- the government is essentially in the words of Tim <unk> "What we do together because we don't know.
Now, a lot of people have abandoned the government.
If you are one of those people -- I would ask you, because the things are changing.
The political policy is not going to be the government itself.
And because the government would ultimately go back -- you remember that <unk> the <unk> the way you think about it will affect the way that change.
I didn't know much about government when I started with this.
And as a lot of people thought that the government was to choose people to be able to <unk>
Well, after two years, I have come to the conclusion that the government is, mostly about <unk>
This is the center of services and information system.
It's the place that serves the calls if you make <unk> in the U.S.
Scott <unk> this phone call.
He joined <unk> on official knowledge.
I found nothing. It started with animal control.
And he finally said, "Hey, you can open the door to the house, put a very strong music and see if you were <unk>
And it worked. So well for Scott.
But that wasn't the end of the <unk>
Boston doesn't have a call center.
It has a <unk> and mobile phone called <unk> <unk>
We don't have that application.
It was the work of very intelligent people from the Office of New York <unk> in Boston.
One day, this really happened to come up with this <unk> <unk> in my cube of trash -- I don't know if it's dead.
How do I do to <unk>
The <unk> dynamics is different.
Scott was talking in person.
In <unk> <unk> it's all public, so everyone can see this.
In this case, he saw it a neighbor.
The next report said, "I went to the place, I found the cube garbage behind the house.
<unk> Yeah. <unk> Yes.
I went home. I went home.
Good nights, sweet <unk>
Quite simple.
This is great. It's the confluence of digital and <unk>
And it's also a great example of the government of government to collaboration with collaboration in collaboration as well.
But it's also a great example of government as a platform.
And here I don't necessarily mean the definition of technological technology.
I'm talking about a platform for people to get together and help others.
So, a citizen helped another but here the government had a key role.
I connected two people.
And I could have them connected to the government services of being necessary but the neighbor is a better and cheaper than the government services.
When one neighbor helps another one, <unk> the communities.
If we call animal control, it costs a lot of money.
One important thing we need to think about the government is that it's not the same as politics.
A lot of people do it, but think that one is the entrance to the other.
That our input to the government system is the <unk>
How many times have we chosen a political leader, sometimes we spend a lot of energy to choose a new political leader, and then we hope that the government is <unk> our values and we <unk> our needs, but then we don't see changes.
That's because the government is like an immense ocean and politics is the surface of 15 <unk>
below what we call <unk>
And we say that word with a lot of contempt.
But it's that <unk> what keeps us that belongs to us that we funded as something that operates against us, that one thing, and we're missing the power.
People believe that politics is sexy.
If we want this institution to work, we will have to make the bureaucracy that the bureaucracy is sexy.
Because it's where the real work of government.
We have to collaborate with the machinery of government.
That makes the <unk> movement.
They've been <unk>
It's a group of citizens concerned that they have written a very detailed <unk> report in response to the order of <unk> <unk> <unk> about the financial reform project.
That's not political activism -- it's <unk>
And for those of us that have been <unk> in the government, it's time to ask ourselves what world we want to leave with our children.
You have to see the huge challenges that they have to face.
Do you really believe that we can get to where we have to go without solving the institution that can act on behalf of <unk>
We can't have a mess of government, we need it to be more effective.
The good news is that with technology is possible to rethink the root function of government so that it can expand to civil society.
There's a generation that grew up with the Internet and knows that it's not so hard to act <unk> only has to articulate the systems in the right way.
The age of the age of our members is 28 years old, so I -- to <unk> I'm a older generation than many of them.
This is a generation that has grown up taking the word and giving that almost for granted.
They're not giving that battle that we all face about who is going to <unk> everybody will talk.
They can express their opinions at the same time and they do.
So when they face the government problem doesn't really care about making their voices.
They're using hands.
They put hands on the work to program applications that make the government work better.
And those applications allow us to use our hands to improve our communities.
It can be cleaning up a <unk> taking out of <unk> <unk> a bucket of garbage that has a <unk> inside.
We were always able to have cleaned up those <unk> and a lot of people do.
But these applications are like digital <unk> that we are not only consumers, not only are we consumers of government we pay taxes and services.
We are more than that: we're citizens.
And we're not going to fix the government until we don't get the <unk>
So I want to ask all of you, when it comes to the important things that we need to do together, all together, we will be a crowd of voices, or we will also be a crowd of hands?
Thank you.
This is a real honor.
I've spent most of the time in prisons, prisons and death row.
I've spent most of my life in communities in communities and places where there is a lot of despair.
And I'll be here at TED and seeing and hearing these stimulus has given me a lot of energy.
One of the things I've noticed in this short time, is that TED has identity.
And the things that are told here have impact around the world.
Sometimes if something comes from TED, it has a sense and a force that wouldn't have any other way.
I say this because I think identity is <unk> important.
Here we have seen fantastic presentations here.
And I think that we have learned that the words of a teacher can have a lot of sense, but if they teach feeling, they can have a special meaning.
A doctor can do good things, <unk> if it's <unk> it can get a lot more.
So I want to talk about the power of identity.
I didn't actually learn this in the practice of the law, my job.
I learned it from my grandmother.
I grew up in a traditional house of a family <unk> dominated by a <unk> which was my grandmother.
It was hard -- it was <unk> he had power.
It was the last word in all of the family.
She <unk> a lot of <unk> in our home.
It was a daughter of people who had been slaves.
His parents were born in slavery in Virginia <unk>
She was born about the <unk> and his experience with slavery <unk> the way the world looked like.
She was hard, but it was also <unk>
When I was a little bit, and I looked at it, she was approaching me and gave me a good <unk>
I was so strong that I could barely breathe and then <unk>
One or two hours later, I went back to <unk> and I was like, <unk> you still feel my <unk>
And if he said no, I would get back to me again, and if he said that yes, I was left in peace.
I had this human quality that I would always wish to be near it.
The only problem is I had 10 children.
My mother was the lower than 10.
Ultimately, when I was going to spend a time with it, it wasn't easy to get his time and their attention.
My cousins were running around everywhere.
I remember when I was eight or nine years old, I went to the room, and I went to the room, and there were all my cousins.
My grandmother was on the other side of the room, and I looked at me.
At first I thought I was a game.
So I looked at it, and I was <unk> but she was very serious.
After 15 or 20 minutes, she got up, I went through the room, and he took me out of his hand, and he said, "Come on, <unk> <unk>
I remember this as if it was yesterday.
I'll never forget it.
He took me outside and said, <unk> I'll tell you something, but you can't tell you <unk>
I said, "Okay, <unk>
She said, "Now <unk> <unk> I said, "Sure."
Then I sat down, and he looked at me, and he said, "I want you to know that I've been <unk>
And <unk> <unk> that you're <unk>
He said, "I think you can do what you do.
I'll never forget it.
And then he said, "I want you to give me three things, <unk>
I said, <unk> <unk>
And he said, "The first thing I want you to tell me is you always want your mother."
<unk> <unk> is my <unk> and you have to <unk> that the <unk>
Like me <unk> my mom, I said, "Yes, <unk> so <unk>
And then he said, "The second thing I want you to tell me is that you will always do the right thing even though the right thing is going to be <unk>
I thought about it, and I said, "Yes, <unk> So <unk>
And then he finally said, "The third thing I want you to tell me is that you would never be <unk>
I was nine years old, and I said, "Yes, <unk> so <unk>
I grew up in the field in the <unk> I have a brother a year older and a little older year and a year.
When I was 14  15, one day my brother came home with a <unk> <unk> I don't know where the <unk> got me and me and went to the forest.
We just did the <unk> of the always, always, the <unk>
He took a pair of beer, he gave my sister, she took a little bit and offered me to me.
I said, "No, no, no. All right. You know, but I'm not going to take <unk>
My brother said, <unk> <unk> And you always do the same as you do.
I already took something, your sister as well.
I said, "No. I wouldn't feel good. You can <unk>
Then my brother looked at me <unk>
And he said, "What's going on? Take a <unk>
I went down to the <unk> look at the strength and <unk> "Ah, not to be in thinking about the conversation with <unk>
I said, "But what are you talking about?"
He said, <unk> tells all the grandchildren that are <unk>
I was <unk>
I have to admit to you.
I'll tell you something that you probably shouldn't say.
I know this is spreading <unk>
But I'm 52 years old, and I can admit that I've never taken a drop of alcohol.
I'm not saying this is a <unk> I say it by the power of identity.
When we create the right type of identity, we say things to others that they don't really make sense.
We can't get them to do things that they don't think of being able to do.
I think my grandmother naturally believed that all their grandchildren were special.
My grandfather had been a prisoner during the <unk>
My uncles died of age-related <unk>
And these were the things that, according to it, we should be <unk>
Now, try to talk about our criminal justice system.
This country is very different today than it was 40 years ago.
In <unk> there were 300,000 prisoners.
There are 2.3 million.
In America we have the largest <unk> rate in the world.
We have seven million people on freedom.
And this mass mass in my view, has changed our world.
In poor and black communities, it is so much <unk> so much despair, by these facts.
One of three black men between 18 and 30 years is in prison or freedom in it.
In urban <unk> across the country, Los Angeles, Philadelphia, Washington, 50 to 60 to 60 to 60 to 60 to 60 percent of all the color in prison or freedom.
Our system is not only distorted in front of race, it's also about poverty.
In this country we have a court system that makes you much better if you're rich and pretend that if you're poor and innocent.
It's not <unk> it's wealth that affects the results.
And it seems like we feel very <unk>
The politics of fear and anger make us believe that these are not problems with us.
We're <unk>
It seems interesting.
We're looking at our work in our work some very curious.
In my state, in Alabama, as well as other states, you care about rights, because you have a criminal <unk>
Right now in Alabama, the <unk> of black male population has lost the right to vote.
And if we projected it to the next 10 years the level of loss of rights will be as high as it was before they <unk> law law to vote.
We have this remarkable silence.
I represent children.
Many of my customers are very young.
The United States is the only country in the world where <unk> children are reported to die in prison.
We have this country in prison for children, no chance to go out.
We are in the process of some <unk>
The only country in the world.
<unk> people in death row.
This issue of death penalty is interesting.
In a certain sense, you've got to think that the final question is, people deserve to die by <unk> <unk>
A very sensitive question.
But you can think about another way about how we are in our identity.
There's another way of <unk> it's not about deciding whether people deserve to die for <unk> crimes but if we are <unk>
This is interesting.
The death row in America is defined by error.
In every nine people, <unk> people have identified one that is innocent and liberated from death row.
A rate of mistake, <unk> a innocent one by nine.
This is interesting.
The aviation is not allowed to fly away, if in every nine to <unk> you would have been <unk>
But somehow we have a problem with the problem.
It's not our problem.
It's not our charge.
It's not our struggle.
I talk a lot about these things.
I'm talking about race and this issue of whether we <unk> to kill.
It's interesting that in my classes with students on history -- I talk to you about slavery today.
I talk about terrorism, the time that started at the end of the rebuilding and that lasted until the Second World War.
We really don't know a lot about this.
But for the black Americans in this country, it was a time defined by terror.
In many communities people were afraid to be <unk>
They were worried about being <unk>
The threat of terror was what defined his lives.
Now there are older people who come to me and say, "Mr. Stevenson, you tend to talk to talks, makes it <unk> <unk> people who stop saying that in our history we deal with the first time with terrorism, after the <unk>
They ask me to say, "No. Say <unk> who grew up with that."
The age of terrorism went on, obviously, with <unk> and decades of doing racial and <unk>
In this country we have a dynamic that we don't like to talk about our problems.
We don't like to talk about our story.
And that's why we haven't understood the meaning of what we've historically done.
All the time we have to do with each other.
We constantly create tensions and conflict.
It costs us work to talk about races. I think it's because we're not willing to engage them with a truth and reconciliation.
In South Africa, people understood that they couldn't overcome <unk> <unk> without a commitment to the truth and reconciliation.
In Rwanda, even before the genocide had this commitment, but in this country we haven't done it.
I was in Germany on death death <unk>
It was fascinating because one of the teachers stood after my presentation and said, "You know it's very disturbing to listen to what you're going to do.
<unk> "We don't have death death in Germany.
We will never be able to get it here."
The room was silent and a lady said, "There's no way with our history, we could never get into the systematic death of human beings.
It would be irrational that we are, <unk> and <unk> we were going to put to the <unk>
So let's think about this.
How would we feel in a world where a nation like Germany, <unk> people, especially if they were mostly <unk>
We couldn't do it <unk>
It would be important.
And yet, there's this disconnection.
I think our identity is in danger.
If we don't really care about these issues, the positive things and wonderful things are, though, <unk>
We love innovation.
We are all fascinated by technology. <unk> creativity.
We love entertainment.
But <unk> those realities are <unk> by suffering, abuse, <unk> <unk>
In my view, you need to integrate both things.
lately talking about the need to have more hope, more engagement, more dedication to the basic challenges of this complex world.
I think that means spending more time thinking and talking about the poor, the <unk> which will never come to TED.
And if you think about them is, in some ways, something that's within our being.
It's true that we have to believe in issues we haven't seen.
So we are. In spite of being so rational, so committed to the intellectual thing.
And the development of innovation, development comes not just about brain ideas.
These things come from ideas -- also by the convictions of the heart.
This connection to the heart is what drives us to look at not just the brilliant and <unk> but also in the dark and the hard.
<unk> <unk> the great <unk> leader was talking about this.
He said, "When we were in East Europe, suffering from <unk> we wanted all sorts of things, but mainly what we needed was hope, orientation for spirit, an will for being in places and being <unk>
Well, that orientation for the spirit is pretty much at the heart of what I think, even in communities like TED, must be <unk>
There is no disconnect with the technology and the design, that allows us to be truly human if we don't pay attention to poverty, to force it to inequality, in injustice.
Now I want to tell you that these thoughts make a much more challenging identity than if we ignore these things.
We go back to <unk>
I had the great privilege, being a very young lawyer -- to meet Rosa <unk>
These women were just allowed to talk.
Occasionally, <unk> lady called me -- to say, <unk> comes the <unk> <unk>
You want to come and <unk>
I was like, "I know lady. I do."
So she was like, "Well what are you going to do when you <unk>
I read him <unk>
And so I was going and just <unk>
It was very <unk> very <unk>
And on one occasion I was there, listening to these <unk> and after a couple of hours, Mrs. Parks went to me and said, "Now, what is that idea of justice <unk>
Tell me what you're trying to do."
And I started giving him my speech.
I said, "Well, we're trying to question injustice.
We try to help those who have been been doomed to help us.
We try to confront prejudice and discrimination in criminal justice.
We try to end up with the life sentences for life, without freedom for children.
We try to do something about death.
We try to reduce the population in prisons.
We try to end the <unk> <unk>
I gave him all my best speech, and I looked at me and said, <unk> <unk> <unk>
And <unk> <unk> very <unk>
At that time, Ms. <unk> <unk> got my finger on the face and said, "This is why you have to be very <unk> but very <unk>
I think actually, the TED community has to be much more <unk>
We need to figure out how to deal with those challenges, those problems, that suffering.
Because finally humanity depends on compassion for others.
I've learned some very simple things in my work.
I've been <unk> in simple stuff.
I've come to understand and believe that every one of us is higher to the worst we've ever heard.
I think that's true for everybody on the planet.
I'm convinced that if somebody says a lie, it's not because it's a liar.
I'm sure if somebody takes something that doesn't <unk> it's not a <unk>
Even if somebody kills another one, it's not a <unk>
So I think there's basic dignity in people who should be <unk> by law.
I also think that in many parts of this country and certainly in many parts of the world, the opposite of poverty is not wealth.
It's not.
I really think that in many parts the opposite of poverty is justice.
And finally, I think it's very beautiful, very beautiful, very <unk> very <unk> not to tell us about our technology, by our designs, not for our intellectual capacity or rational.
And at the end of the society, the character of a society, not by the way they treat rich and powerful <unk> but by the way they treat the poor, they <unk> the prisoners.
Because it's in this context as we start to understand truly profound issues about what we are.
I feel <unk> I'm going to end with a story.
Sometimes I do too much force.
<unk> tired, like everyone.
Sometimes those ideas go beyond my <unk> in a very important way.
I've been representing these guys who have been <unk> with a lot of <unk>
I'm going to jail and I see my age of 13 and 14 years old, who have been <unk> so they were <unk> as adults.
And I start thinking, how can it be?
How could a judge turn to someone who is not it?
The judge would take it as an adult, but I see a kid.
One night too late I was up to her <unk> God, if the judge can turn it into something you don't are, you have to have magical powers.
Yes, <unk> the judge has magical powers.
You should ask for some of that.
As I was very late, I couldn't think correctly, but I started working on a <unk>
I had a 14 years old, a small, white.
I started working on the <unk> with a <unk> who said, <unk> so that my 14-year-old <unk> is treated as a <unk> <unk> of a <unk>
In the <unk> I had that there have been <unk> behavior in the <unk> in the behavior of the police and the process.
There was a <unk> line on how in this country -- there's no ethical line, but a whole lack of ethics.
The next morning, I woke up thinking that <unk> <unk> would be a dream -- or really <unk>
For my horror, not only had it <unk> he was sent to the cut.
It was about two months, and I had already forgotten it.
And I finally said, "Oh my God, I have to go to court for this case stupid.
I got to the car and I felt truly <unk>
I was in the car court.
I thought this would be very difficult and <unk>
I finally got out of the car, he walked to court.
I was going up the stairs when I found a black man <unk> was the <unk> of court.
When I saw me, he came up to me and said, "Who is you?"
I said, "I'm a <unk> he <unk> "It's <unk> I said yes.
So I came up to me and get me wrong.
And I would stand on the ear,
He said, "I'm proud of <unk>
I have to tell you now that that was <unk>
That was deeply connected to my inside, with my identity with the ability that we all have to contribute to the community with a sense of hope.
Well, I walked into the audiences.
When I walked in, the judge saw me.
And he said, "Mr. Stevenson, you wrote this <unk> <unk>
I said, "Yes, Mr. <unk> And we began to go on.
People started to get there. They were all <unk>
I was the one that had written those <unk>
They got the cops cops <unk> <unk> <unk>
Suddenly, I didn't know how, the room was full of people, and they were born, because we talked about races, because we talked about poverty, because we talked about inequality.
With the <unk> of the eye, I went to see the <unk> which was going and <unk>
I would look out the window and you can see that <unk>
He was walking over here and to there.
Finally, this old black <unk> <unk> I walked in the room and sat behind me, almost on the lawyers.
About 10 minutes later, the judge would have a <unk>
During the break a <unk> he was shown upset because the <unk> had entered the room.
The assistant ran over the old black <unk>
And he said, <unk> what do you do in the <unk> room.
And the old black stood foot, and I looked at the <unk> and he looked at me and he said, "You know, <unk> this young <unk> to tell this young man who would keep her view in the goal with <unk>
I have come to TED today because I think many of you understand that the moral arc of the universe is very big, but it's folding towards justice.
We cannot be truly human rights if we don't care about human rights and for dignity.
That our survival is linked to each other.
That our visions of technology, design entertainment and creativity should lead to <unk> <unk> and justice.
And above all, those of you here who share this -- I just want to tell you that we keep sight in the goal with <unk>
Thank you very much.
Chris Anderson: <unk> to hear and see an obvious desire for the audience, of this community, to help in your way, to do something.
Something that is not a check.
<unk> There are several opportunities nearby.
If you live in the state of California, for example, there will be a <unk> this spring in which you will do a effort to make the money you spend today in policy policies.
For example, here in California, you're going to spend a billion dollars in death penalty in the next five years, billion dollars.
And despite this, the <unk> of the English cases, not <unk> in <unk>
<unk> <unk> don't get to anything.
Here's a chance of change.
This <unk> is going to come up with these money to make the law, the law for safety.
I think there's a very close opportunity.
CA: There have been a huge decline in the <unk> in the United States, in the last three decades.
Part of the explanation, it says that it has to do with the biggest rate of <unk>
What would you say to those who believe this is this?
<unk> Actually, the rate of <unk> with violence has remained relatively stable.
The great growth in mass <unk> in this country is not by crimes with violence.
It's because of the wrong war for drugs.
That's why it comes out of this dramatic rise in the population.
And we let us convince the rhetoric of the punishment.
We have three legal causes to bring people into the <unk> chain to rob a bicycle, for small crimes against property, rather than making it <unk> those resources to their victims.
I think we need to do more to help the victims of the <unk> and not less.
I think that our current philosophy is that our current philosophy about punishment does nothing for anybody.
I think that's the orientation that has to change.
CA: <unk> are you excited about today here.
You're very inspiring.
Thank you very much for having come to TED. Thank you.

Oh, my God.
Peter <unk> These are just some of the clips I got in the last six months. They could be from the last six days or the last six years.
The idea is that the media would prefer <unk> negative news, because our minds pay attention.
And that responds to a very good reason.
In every single second day our senses are getting a lot more data from which the brain is probably going to be <unk>
And as nothing matters to us more than survive, the first stop all of this data is an ancient clip of the temporal lobe called <unk>
The amygdala is our early warning detector, the danger.
<unk> and records all the information looking for something in the environment that could make us harm.
So this is why of a <unk> stories of stories, <unk>
That old adage of <unk> "If there are blood, <unk> is very true.
And because all digital devices give us negative news -- the seven days of the week, 24 hours a day, no wonder we're <unk>
It's not surprising that people think that the world is going wrong in worse.
But maybe it's not like that.
Maybe what really happens is we get <unk>
Perhaps the huge progress was done in the last century by a series of forces of forces that have the potential to create a world of abundance in the next three decades.
I'm not saying that we don't have our good problems -- climate change, the species of species, water <unk> and <unk> we certainly have them.
As human beings are very good at <unk> the problems and, in the long run, we just have them.
<unk> then what happened in the last century to see where we go.
In the last hundred years, the average of life has been more than <unk> the average average income for inflation has been <unk> around the world.
<unk> child mortality has reduced 10 times.
Also, the cost of food food, the cost of transportation and communications, has dropped 10 to 1,000 times.
Steve <unk> showed us that we're living the most peaceful time of human history.
And Charles <unk> that global literacy went from 25 to more than 80 percent in the last 130 years.
We're really living an extraordinary time.
A lot of people have been <unk>
And we keep <unk> more and higher expectations ...
In fact, <unk> the meaning of poverty.
<unk> today in the United States, a lot of the people who live under the line of poverty have electricity, water, <unk> television, mobile TV, air conditioning and cars.
The <unk> <unk> from the last century, the <unk> of the planet, would never have dreamed of such <unk>
You know, you know, a lot of this is the technology and then take its exponential growth.
My good Ray Kurzweil friend showed that any tool that <unk> in information technology jumps on this curve, Moore's Law, and double the performance price at about 12 to 24 months.
So the mobile phone you have in your pocket is a million times cheaper and a thousand times faster than a supercomputer in the '70s.
Now look at this curve.
It's Moore's Law for the last hundred years.
I want you to look at two things on this curve.
First, how soft that is -- at good and bad times, in war and peace, in recession and <unk>
It's the fast computers that used to build a faster computers.
It doesn't stop before none of the great challenges.
And even though it's <unk> on a law on the left, it goes up.
The growth rate of technology is getting faster.
And on this curve, to <unk> of Moore's Law, there's a series of extraordinarily powerful technologies that we have today.
<unk> in the cloud, that my friends in <unk> call infinite computing and networks, and they networks, the 3D printing and the 3D printing and their ability to democratize personalized biology, in the planet, synthetic biology, fuel fuels and food medicine, <unk> and <unk>
I mean, how many saw the victory on "Jeopardy" <unk>
It was <unk>
I tried to look at the newspapers the best headline than <unk>
And I loved this: <unk> <unk> <unk>
"Jeopardy" is not an easy game.
It plays with the <unk> of human language.
Imagine this artificial intelligence in the cloud, available for everyone on the phone.
Four years ago, here at TED, Ray Kurzweil and I, we launched a new university called <unk> <unk>
We teach these technologies to our students, and in particular, how can they be used to solve the great challenges of humanity.
And every year we asked them to release one company, or a product or service, that can affect the lives of a billion people in a decade.
Think about that, the fact that a group of students can impact the lives of a billion people.
Thirty years ago, that would have <unk>
Today we can point out a <unk> of companies that have already done it.
When I think of creating abundance, it doesn't mean to create <unk> life for every single <unk> it's about creating a life of possible.
It's about taking that that's <unk> and making it <unk>
You see, the scarcity is <unk> and technology is a force that releases resources.
I'll give you an example.
This is a story of Napoleon <unk> in the middle of the 1800.
He's the guy on the left.
<unk> the king of <unk>
<unk> workers ate with <unk> and the same <unk> with gold <unk>
But the king of <unk> ate with aluminum <unk>
You see, aluminum was the most valuable metal in the planet, and it was worth the gold and the <unk>
That's why the tip of the Washington line is aluminum <unk>
You see, even though aluminum is the <unk> of the mass of the Earth, it doesn't come as a <unk>
It's tied by oxygen and <unk>
But then the <unk> came up and made it so cheap that we used it as if it was <unk>
We have this analogy to the future.
Let's think about energy.
Ladies and gentlemen, we're on a planet <unk> for 5,000 times more energy than we use in a year.
They get to the Earth 16 <unk> of energy every <unk> minutes.
It's not about need, but <unk>
And there's good news.
This year, for the first time, the cost of solar energy in India is 50 percent less than the generated by <unk> <unk> rupees versus 17 rupees.
The cost of solar energy dropped 50 percent last year.
Last month, MIT published a study that shows that in the end of the decade, in the U.S. parts of the United States, solar electricity will cost six cents an hour, compared to the 15 cents of national average.
And if we have abundance of energy we have abundance of water.
So let's talk about wars for water.
Do you remember when Carl Sagan pointed out to pointed at the Earth, in 1990, in 1990, after I spent <unk>
<unk> a famous photo -- how do you <unk>
"A <unk> <unk> point.
Because we live on a water planet.
We live on a planet covered in 70 percent for water.
Yes, the <unk> is saltwater, and two percent is ice, and <unk> by the <unk> of the planet, but there's also a hope.
It's a technology available not 10 or 20 years, but right now.
It comes the nanotechnology, the <unk>
In a conversation with Dean Kamen -- this morning, one of the innovators of <unk> I would like to share with you, gave me permission to <unk> your technology called <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> is the size of a small refrigerator size.
It is able to generate a thousand liters of drinking water to the day of any source -- saltwater, water, water, <unk> a <unk> for less than two cents the gallon.
The president of Coca-Cola just thought that will make a significant test for hundreds of units in the developing world.
If that comes out right, and I have full confidence in which it will be, Coca-Cola will implement it in <unk> countries on the planet.
This is a <unk> innovation for this technology that today exists.
And we've seen it on mobile phones.
My God, we're going to get to the 70 percent penetration in the developing world for the end of 2013.
<unk> that warrior <unk> has better mobile communications in the middle of Kenya that President Reagan 25 years ago.
And to have a smart mobile phone, it has access to more knowledge and information than President Clinton 15 years ago.
She lives in a world of abundance of information and communications that nobody could have predicted ever.
So better than that, the things that you and I have paid for tens and hundreds of thousands of dollars -- <unk> video -- images, libraries of books and music, <unk> technology -- now <unk> and lose value value with mobile phones.
Maybe the best thing comes when the applications in health.
Last month, I had the pleasure to announce with the Foundation, which is something called the X <unk> <unk> <unk> 10 million dollars.
We're challenging the teams of the world to bring these technologies into a mobile device with which they speak, and because it has <unk> you can get <unk> you can get blood from your finger.
To win has to make better diagnoses than a certificate.
Imagine this device in the middle of the developing world where there are no doctors, where the <unk> charge is 25 percent of the health care workers.
When this device is <unk> a virus of RNA or DNA that we don't want to call the health and the first place, it will prevent the pandemic.
But this is the largest force to produce a world of abundance.
I call it the <unk>
The white lines here are the population.
We just went through the seven billion.
By the way, the best protection is to give the world of education and health.
In 2010, we had less than two billion people online, connected.
By 2020, spending from two billion to five billion users of the Internet.
Three billion minds of minds never before we add up to the global conversation.
What will these people?
What <unk> What desires.
And instead of an economic collapse we have the biggest economic injection of history.
These people represent tens of billions of dollars -- in the global economy.
And <unk> of more health, thanks to the <unk> of a better education with the Khan Academy and because of the use of 3D impressions and computing in the cloud will be more productive than ever before.
What can we bring three billion more members of humanity, healthy polite and <unk>
How about some voices never before <unk>
So what if we give them to the prisons, wherever they are, a voice to be heard of, and they can act for the first time?
What are these three <unk>
And if they're contributions we can't <unk>
One thing I learned with the X Prize is that small teams led by their passion with an objective goal, and they can do things that were able to do things that were only able to make big corporations and governments.
I'm going to finish by sharing a story that really <unk> me.
There's a program that maybe some of you have already heard of.
It's called <unk>
<unk> at the University of Washington, in Seattle.
It's a game where people can take a sequence of amino acids and figure out how to fold the protein.
The folds determine the structure and we are.
It's very important in medical research.
And so far, it was a problem of <unk>
They've played with this college teachers in college people.
Then hundreds of thousands of people came together and started <unk>
And it has been shown today that the machinery of human patterns is better at folding proteins than the best computers.
Ladies and gentlemen, what gives me a huge confidence in the future is that today we have more power to take the big challenges on the planet.
We have the tools with this exponential technology.
We have the passion of innovative <unk>
We have the capital of the <unk>
And we have three billion new minds of new minds that are going to be <unk> to work on the solution of great challenges and do what we should do.
We have a few decades in front of them.
Thank you.
I'm going to talk about a very <unk> idea.
<unk> <unk>
And as the idea can be explained in a minute, I will give them three examples to make time.
The first story is about Charles Darwin, one of my heroes.
He was here, as you know, in <unk>
Maybe they believed that <unk> <unk> but it wasn't like that.
<unk> fish.
And he described one of them as <unk>
It was the <unk>
He caught it a lot to the <unk>
Now the fish is in the Red Red <unk>
But we've heard this story a lot of times, all over the Galapagos and other places, so that has nothing special about it.
But the case is that we still come to the Galapagos.
We still think they're <unk>
<unk> still say they keep <unk>
So what happens here?
The second story, also illustrates another concept.
Because I was there in <unk> studying one drop in West Africa.
I was there because I grew up in Europe, and then I wanted to work in Africa.
I thought it could be <unk>
I burned a lot with the sun, and I was convinced that I was not there.
This is my first exposure to the sun.
The water is surrounded by <unk> and as you can see, from a few <unk>
There were <unk> of about 20 centimeter -- the <unk>
And the fishing of this <unk> was very abundant and spent for a good moment, so it was made more than the average in Ghana.
When I went there 27 years later, the amount of fish had dropped in half.
<unk> to the five centimeters high.
We would take a genetic pressure.
There were still fish.
In a way, they were still happy.
And the fish were still happy to be there.
I mean, nothing has changed, but everything has changed.
My third story is that I was <unk> in the introduction of fishing <unk> in Southeast Asia.
In the 1970s -- <unk> started in <unk> Europe did a lot of development projects.
<unk> development was imposing the countries that had 100,000 <unk> <unk> industrial fishing.
And this kind of <unk> <unk> called <unk> four.
I went out fishing in it, and we did studies in the South China Sea <unk> and, above all, in the Ross Sea.
What we captured was something <unk>
<unk> now the bottom of the sea.
Ninety percent of what we capture were <unk> other animals that are in the background.
And most of the fish are <unk> tiny about <unk> remains of the coral reef.
In short, the bottom of the sea came to the deck and then it was <unk>
These images are extraordinary because the transition is very fast.
In a year, you make a study and then you start the commercial fishing game.
The bottom line is going to be a solid coral.
This is a <unk>
Not the <unk> The <unk> because they were dead.
Once we captured a alive.
I was still not <unk>
So they wanted to <unk> because it was a good food.
This mountain of remains is what the fishermen collect every time they go to a area where they have never fish.
But there's no <unk>
<unk> the world, but we don't remember it.
We would start the starting point to start at the new level, without remembering what was there.
If you look at this something like this.
On the axis, we have <unk> biodiversity, and we have a number of <unk> the <unk> of the country, the water supply.
And that changes over time. It changes because people do things with <unk>
Every generation will use <unk> images at the beginning of their conscious life as normal and they extrapolate forward.
The difference is that they perceive the loss of loss.
But they don't perceive the loss that happened before.
You can look at the concept of changes.
And at the end of the end to keep a few <unk> <unk>
And that, in large extent, we want to do it now.
We want to keep things that are no longer or they're not what they were.
But you should think that this problem affects people when societies <unk> kill animals without knowing what they've done to a few generations later.
Because obviously, an animal which is very primitive.
You don't lose animals.
You lose <unk> animals.
Even if this isn't perceived as a great loss.
Over time, we focus on large animals, and in a synonymous for big fish.
They become slightly frequent because the <unk>
Over time they have a few fish, but we think that's the point of <unk>
And the question is, why do we accept this?
Well, because we don't know it was different.
In fact, a lot of people, scientists, <unk> who was very different.
And they will do it because the evidence presented in a way before it is not the way they would expect that they have evidence.
For example, the anecdote that some of the things that some of them would like to look like that captain just looked at a lot of fish in this area cannot be used or, usually they don't use the scientists in the fish, because it's not <unk>
So we have a situation where people don't know the past, even though we lived in <unk> societies, because they don't rely on the sources of the past.
Out of the huge role that can be a protected area.
Because with the marine areas, we really visualize the past.
<unk> the past people can't conceive of because the starting point has been run and incredibly low.
That's for the people that you can see a marine protected area.
And what about people who can't do that because they don't have access, like people in the West -- for example?
I think that the arts and film, maybe you can fill the vacuum. The simulation.
This is a simulation of the Bay of <unk>
A lot of time ago there were gray whales in the <unk> Bay Area 500 years ago.
And you may have noticed that the <unk> and <unk> are like <unk>
And if you think about <unk> if you think about why people were moved with the movie <unk> to talk about the history of <unk> why are we <unk>
Because it raises something that, in a certain sense, has been lost.
So my <unk> the only one I give, it is because we can make <unk> <unk>
Thank you very much.
Hello. I'm Kevin <unk> the <unk> <unk> and I look at YouTube videos in a professional form.
It's true.
So today, we're going to see why the videos are made viral and what importance to it.
We all want to be <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> When I was younger -- that seemed very, very hard.
But now the web video does that any of us or our actions, have come into a part of our global culture.
Anyone can be famous on the Internet in a <unk>
They go over 48 hours of video to YouTube a minute.
And of those, just a little percentage is viral gets a infinite number of visits and it makes cultural <unk>
How does that happen?
Three things: creators of engaging and surprise.
Well, <unk>
<unk> <unk> Oh, my God, my God.
My God.
Wow.
<unk> <unk>
KA: Last year, <unk> <unk> published this video shot outside his house in Yellowstone National Park.
In 2010, it was seen 23 million times.
This graph shows the <unk> at the rise of popular summer.
<unk> was not supposed to do a viral video.
I just wanted to share a <unk> <unk>
That's what you do if it's called <unk> Mountain <unk>
He had already published many videos of nature.
This video had been published in January.
So what happened here?
It was Jimmy <unk>
Jimmy <unk> published this asking the video to the <unk>
The creators of trends as Jimmy <unk> are presented with new things and interesting things that are going on to a larger audience.
Rebecca <unk>  It's Friday, a Friday. You have to start on Friday.   You all want to get the weekend.   You all want it to get the end of a week, the weekend.                  So you would not think we could have this conversation without talking about this video, I
<unk> of Black Rebecca is one of the most popular videos of the year.
They saw it almost 200 million times this year.
This graph shows the frequency of use.
Just like <unk> <unk> this video seemed to be emerged from nowhere.
So what happened this day?
Well, it was Friday, it's true.
And if you ask those other <unk> they're also Friday.
But what happened this day, this particular <unk>
Well, I took it <unk> and lots of blogs started to write about it.
Michael J. <unk> of <unk> Science -- was one of the first people in making a joke about the video on Twitter.
But the important thing is that one person or a force group of trends will take a point of view and share it with a broader audience, accelerating the process.
So this one community of people who share this great internal joke then starts to talk about and do things.
And now there are 10,000 <unk> <unk> on YouTube.
Just in the first seven days, there was a parody for each of the other days.
Unlike the <unk> entertainment difference of the 20th century, this community participation is our way to be part of the <unk> phenomenon, or doing something new with <unk>
<unk> <unk> is an <unk> animation with a <unk> music.
So that's it.
This year you saw it about 50 million times.
And if you think that's weird -- you know that there's a version of three hours that you've seen four million times.
Even cats saw this video.
And there are cats who saw other cats see the video.
But the important thing here is creativity that woke up between the <unk> community of the Internet.
There was <unk>
Someone did a version of the ancient one.
And then he became an international one.
Suddenly, a whole community of <unk> that made this happen to be a silly joke to something that we can all form part.
Because today not only does it look at it.
Who could have predicted something like this?
Who might have predicted <unk> <unk> or finger, Black or <unk> <unk>
What are the script might have been written out of this <unk>
In a world that you go up two days of video a minute, just the only unexpected and unexpected can be <unk> so that these things have done it.
When a friend told me that I had to see this great video of a guy who protest against <unk> in New York, I admit I didn't really feel too much.
Casey <unk> I <unk> because of the <unk> but often there are obstacles that prevent you properly from the <unk>
KA: Thank you the surprise and the humor, Casey Casey <unk> I managed to get five million and understand his idea.
So this is worth the whole new approach to all the new we do <unk>
And all of this leads us to a great question.
<unk> <unk> What does this mean?
<unk>
KA: What does this mean?
<unk> communities creative communities of participation, the totally unexpected, are characteristics of a new media and a new culture, which we all have access to and is the audience that defines the <unk>
As I said before, one of the celebrities of the world, <unk> <unk> started on YouTube.
You don't get permission to express your ideas.
Now we're all a little owners of our pop culture.
These are not the characteristics of the old media, and they're just the current media, but it was <unk> entertainment of the future.
Thank you.
This is not a <unk> story.
It's a puzzle that's still <unk>
Let me tell you about some of the pieces.
Imagine the first <unk> a man burning the work of a whole life.
It's a poet, a <unk> a man whose entire life had been supportive of the only one unit and freedom in his country.
<unk> as the <unk> go into <unk> <unk> the fact that their life had been totally in vain.
The words, for so long friends, friends, <unk>
It <unk> in silence.
He died broken by history.
He's my grandfather.
I never met him.
But our lives are much more than our memories.
My grandmother never allowed me to forget his story.
My task was not to let that have been in <unk> and my lesson was to learn that the story was trying to <unk> but it was <unk>
The next part of the puzzle is about a boat at dawn -- <unk> <unk> towards the sea.
My mother, <unk> was only 18 years old when her father died, and a <unk> marriage marriage and two little girls.
For her, life had been destined for a <unk> task to escape his family and a new life in Australia.
It was <unk> for her that I couldn't do that.
And after a <unk> <unk> that challenges the fiction, a boat goes into the sea as it was dressed in the sea as it was <unk>
All the adults knew the risks.
The greatest fear was the largest and the rape and death.
Like most adults, my mother was wearing a <unk> with poison.
If we were going to first take it out, we would take my sister and I, and then she and my grandmother.
My first memories are from that boat, the constant pace of the engine, the <unk> you put it down in every wave, and the entire vast and empty horizon.
I don't remember the hackers that came several times, but they were <unk> with the courage of men on our boat, or the dying engine, and not being able to start for six hours.
But I do remember the lights out of the oil platform in front of the coast of Malaysia, and the young man who collapsed and died, I would end up the journey was too much to kill it, and the first apple I tried, given by the men in the platform.
No apple had the same flavor.
After three months in a refugee camp, <unk> in <unk>
And the next piece of the puzzle is about four women over three generations shaping a new life together.
We set up in <unk> a <unk> class, whose population is comprised of jail.
Unlike the average middle class <unk> the existence of <unk> in <unk> there was no sense of right.
The smells that came from stores were the rest of the world.
And the fragments of <unk> <unk> <unk> among people who had one thing in common: they were starting again.
My mother worked in farms, then in a car assembly line, working six days, double turn.
And yet, I found time to study English and get a degree in <unk> <unk> <unk>
We were poor.
All the dollars were <unk> and established an extra note in English and mathematics, no matter what was supposed to be <unk> which is always <unk> <unk> always <unk>
Two pairs of average for school, one to hide the holes of the other.
A school uniform to the <unk> because I had to last six years.
And there was weird <unk> and <unk> on the <unk> <unk> and some <unk> <unk> back again.
home.
One of me was <unk>
I was accumulating determination and a voice saying, "I'm going to <unk>
My mother, my sister and I <unk> in the same bed.
My mother was <unk> every night, but we were terrified about our day and <unk> the movements of our grandmother at the house.
My mother had <unk> all of the boat.
And my task was to be wake up until his nightmares started to be able to <unk>
She opened up a computers, and then I studied to be <unk> and he opened up another business.
And women would come with their stories about men who couldn't do the job, angry and <unk> and <unk> boys caught between two worlds.
They looked for subsidies and <unk>
And they were created centers.
I lived in worlds parallel.
In one, it was the classic <unk> <unk> with what I <unk> of myself.
On the other hand, I was <unk> in life -- increasingly, <unk> by violence, drug abuse and isolation.
But many people had help over the years.
And for that work, when I was studying my last year of boy, I was choosing the young Australian of the year.
And I was <unk> from one piece of the puzzle to the other, but the edges of the puzzle is not <unk>
So <unk> resident <unk> was now as well as <unk> refugee and social activist and invited to speak in sites that I'd never heard of, and in houses whose existence had never imagined.
I didn't know the <unk>
I didn't know how to use the <unk>
I didn't know how to talk about wine.
I didn't know how to talk about anything.
I wanted to retreat into the <unk> and the comfort of life in a suburb <unk> -- a grandmother, a mother and two daughters ending up the day as they did for nearly 20 years, <unk> on the day of every single bed.
And I told my mom that I couldn't do it.
It reminded me that I was now the same age as she had when she got it up to the ship.
The "no" never was an option.
<unk> told me, "What not <unk>
So I talked about <unk> youth and education and <unk> to the marginalized and <unk>
And the more frankly speak -- more it was <unk> to talk.
I met people from all the roads in life, many of them doing what they would do, living on the border of possible.
And although I ended up my <unk> I realized I couldn't stay in a <unk> race.
There had to be another piece of the puzzle.
And I realized at the same time that's okay to be a stranger, a newly new, new thing in the scene -- and not only it's good, but it's something that will be grateful, maybe a gift of the ship.
Because it can easily mean <unk> <unk> can easily mean to accept the assumptions of your <unk>
I gave enough steps out of my comfort zone to know that, yes, the world <unk> but not the way we fear it.
<unk> that had not been <unk> were <unk>
There was an energy there, a <unk> optimism -- a blend of humility and <unk>
So I followed my intuition.
It was going to be a small group of people who are not <unk> it was a <unk>
For a year we didn't have a <unk>
At the end of every day, he was doing a giant <unk> soup that all <unk>
<unk> to the night.
Most of our ideas were crazy -- but some brilliant, and we opened up.
I made the decision to move to the U.S.
after one journey.
My <unk>
Three months later, I had <unk> and the adventure <unk>
Before end, let me tell you about my grandmother.
She grew up in a time where the <unk> was the social norm and the local <unk> was the person who worried about.
Life didn't change for centuries.
His father died soon after she was born.
The mother grew up alone.
At 17 became a <unk> whose mother <unk>
No support of his husband, caused a <unk> to the <unk> and to take the cause she is, and so much more <unk> caused when I won.
You can't ask it to be wrong.
I was in the shower in the hotel room in <unk> when she died, a thousand miles in <unk>
I looked through the <unk> of the shower and I saw them stop the other side.
I knew I had come to <unk>
My mother called a minutes later.
Days later, we went to a Buddhist temple in <unk> and we sat around her <unk>
We tell him stories and make sure we were still with it.
The night a Buddhist came and told us that I had to close the <unk>
My mother asked us to hold his hand.
I asked the <unk> "Why his hand is hot, and the rest of the body.
"Because you've taken your hand from the <unk> he said.
"You haven't been <unk>
If there's a nerve in our family, it runs through women.
Since those who were and how life we built us, we can now see that the men who have come to our lives would have been <unk>
The defeat would have <unk> easily.
Now I want to have my own kids, and I wonder about the ship.
Who could wish that to know?
However, I fear the privilege of the easy right.
I can give you a <unk> in your lives, a brave in every wave, the <unk> pace of the engine, the vast horizon that doesn't guarantee nothing?
I don't know.
But if I could make it and see them safe I would do it.
<unk> <unk> and also the mother of this is now here, in the fourth or a fifth row.
My story begins in <unk> about two years ago.
I was in the desert, under the <unk> sky, with the singer <unk> <unk> <unk>
We were having a conversation about how nothing has changed since the old Indian <unk> <unk>
In those days when Indians wanted to travel to a car and <unk> the sky.
Now we do it with airplanes.
At that time when we <unk> the great usual warrior Indian, he had <unk> taking a bow and with a <unk> to the ground, he would find water.
We now do the same with <unk> and machines.
The conclusion that we pulled out was that the machinery had replaced the magic.
And that was a great deal to me.
Every time I felt a little bit more <unk>
I was given this idea of losing the ability to enjoy and appreciate a sunset if I didn't have the camera, if I couldn't afford my friends.
It seemed to me that technology had to allow the magic to allow the magic to be able to let the magic go.
As a child, my grandfather gave me her <unk> <unk>
And this <unk> <unk> technology was for me the most magic thing.
It became a golden door to a world full of images, of hackers and <unk> in my imagination.
I had the feeling that the <unk> the luxury clocks and the cameras are prevent <unk>
<unk> our inspiration.
So I was <unk> and I was brought into this technological world to see how to use it to create magic, instead of <unk>
I took books from the 16 years.
So when I saw the iPad I saw a storytelling device that can connect readers to the entire world.
You can know how we took the book.
Where we are.
We collect the text with the image, the animation, sound and touch.
The storytelling becomes more and more <unk>
But what do we do is what that is for us?
I'm about to launch <unk> an interactive app for the iPad.
He says, <unk> your fingers on every light."
And so ...  He says, "This box belongs to me, I write my name.
And so I get a character from the book.
At a number of times I get a <unk> -- the iPad knows where I live thanks to the GPS -- which comes to me.
My inner girl are excited about all these possibilities.
I've talked a lot about magic.
And I don't mean <unk> and <unk> but that magic of childhood, those ideas that were <unk>
For some reason, fireflies in a jar were always becoming exciting to me.
So here we have to shift the iPad to release fireflies.
And, actually, they light up your way in the rest of the book.
Another idea that I was fascinated with a little girl was that a whole galaxy <unk> in a <unk>
So here, every book and every world becomes a <unk> that I move towards this magic device, within the device.
And this opens up a map.
In every fantasy book, there's always been maps but have been static maps of it.
This is a map that goes up, <unk> and guide you during the rest of the book.
In certain points in the book, they also <unk>
Now I'm going to go in.
Another incredibly important aspect to me is to create Indian content, and the contemporary aspect of contemporary time.
These are the <unk>
We've all heard of <unk> and <unk> but how many people were out of India you know their <unk> <unk> <unk>
These poor <unk> have been trapped in <unk> cameras.
So we're bringing them back into a single child story.
In a story that deals with current issues like the environmental crisis.
And by talking about environmental crisis, one of the last 10 years has been that children have been <unk> attached to their <unk> they have not gone out the outside world.
But now with mobile technology we can take our children into the natural world with their technology.
One of the interactions of the book is this adventure where you have to go outside the outside, take the camera or iPad, and collect pictures of different natural objects.
As a child, I had a lot of <unk> <unk> stones, <unk> and <unk>
For some reason kids don't do it.
So to regain this ritual ritual we have to go out and in a chapter, we would take a picture of a flower and then <unk>
In another chapter, you have to take a picture of a piece of cortex and then <unk>
So this is a whole digital collection of pictures that then can be put on the Web.
A child in London puts a picture of a <unk> and he says, "Oh, today I saw a <unk>
A child of India says, "I saw a <unk>
And it creates this kind of social network around a collection of digital pictures that have been taking.
In the relationship variants between magic, the Earth and the technology there are many possibilities.
In the next book, we asked to have an interaction where you get out with the iPad and the video on and by using augmented reality and by using augmented reality.
At a moment the screen is full of leaves at a moment.
And you have to make the sound of wind and <unk> so you can read the rest of the book.
We are going to a world where the forces of nature will engage with technology and magic and technology gets closer to another.
<unk> the energy of the sun.
We are approaching our children and ourselves to the natural world and that magic, and love love and child love and a simple story.
Thank you.
I'd like to talk to you about why many projects of <unk> <unk>
And I think, really, the most important thing about that is we let the patients.
And one of the things we did at the University <unk> was <unk> to a listening.
And not in a very scientific way, she raised a little cup of coffee or you and I asked patients, family and <unk> What do you think?
"How can we <unk>
And we tend to think, that this is one of the biggest problems for what all of us, or maybe not all, but most of the projects of <unk> they fail because we stop listening.
This is my Wi-Fi scale. It's a very simple thing.
Does it have a pair of air and switch up.
Every morning I got up.
And yes, I have a challenge as you can see.
I got the challenge to get to 95 <unk>
But it's so simple, that every time I <unk> it sends my information to Google <unk>
And my doctor of <unk> has access to him as well. So he can see what my weight problem is, not at the same moment in which it needs to be <unk> or some urgency that that, but to see it backwards.
But there's another thing.
Like some of you know, I have more than 4,000 followers on Twitter.
So every morning I connect to my Wi-Fi scale and before I go up to my car, people start to <unk> <unk> today I think you need a light lunch, I think you need to be <unk>
That's the best thing that can happen, because it's pressure of the pairs used to help patients, because it could be used for obesity, and also for patients stop smoking.
On the other hand, it can be <unk> to move people out of their chairs and together develop some <unk> activity to have more control of their health.
From the next week being available to be available.
This little <unk> connected to an iPhone or another device.
And people would go back from their homes, taking their blood pressure, <unk> their doctor, and share it with each other, for example, for 100 dollars.
This is the point where patients assume a position, they go back to control and to be ship <unk> but it can also help us care about health care because of the challenges we face as the firing of the costs of attention to <unk> <unk> of demand and other issues.
<unk> techniques that are very simple to use and start with this to engage patients in the team.
And you can do it with techniques like these, but also by <unk>
And one of the things we did like to share with you with a video of you.
We all have behind navigation navigation in <unk>
We may even have them in our cell phones.
We know perfectly where wireless machines are in <unk>
So where are all the <unk>
And of course, we can find fast food faster.
But where is the closest <unk> to help this patient?
We asked it, but no one was <unk>
Nobody knew where to get the <unk> saves lives right now.
What we did was do <unk> in the Netherlands <unk>
We created a website, and we asked the audience to see a <unk> and you see a <unk> please look at it, and then when it's open, because sometimes you open up in <unk> and others are closed.
And over 10,000 <unk> they were already presented in the Netherlands <unk>
The next step was to look for the application for that.
And we made an app for the iPad.
We created an app for <unk> reality to find these <unk>
And every time you're in the city of <unk> and somebody else can use your iPhone, and the next few weeks to use your phone cell phone to find the nearest <unk> which can save lives.
And from today, I would like to introduce this one, not just like <unk> <unk> which is the name of the product, but also as <unk>
And we want to do it on the world level.
We are <unk> all the colleagues in the world, at other universities, to help us find and act like a center for the <unk> of <unk> around the world.
Every time you're on vacation and someone <unk> can be a relative or somebody in front of you, you can find it.
And also I'd like to invite companies around the world that could help us could do these <unk>
They could be <unk> or <unk> people, for example, to see if the <unk> which is shown is still in their place.
Please go on this and not just improve health, but take control of it.
Thank you very much.
I'm here to share <unk> photograph.
Or is it <unk> <unk>
Because, of course, they're photographs that you can't take with your cameras.
My interest in photography woke up with my first digital camera at the age of 15 years.
I mixed with my earlier passion for the drawing but it was a little bit different because by using the camera the process was in planning.
And when you take a photograph with a camera -- the process ends up when you click the <unk>
For me photography had more to do with being in the right place at the right time.
It seemed like anybody could do it.
So I wanted to create something different, a process that would start by press <unk>
<unk> like this: a building on a very <unk> road <unk>
But it has an unexpected turn.
And even though it keeps a level of <unk>
Or a picture of the dark and dark <unk> at time, but with the common goal of keeping the level of <unk>
And when I say <unk> I say <unk>
Because, of course, it's not something I can do, but I always want it to seem to be captured in some way like photography.
I think you have to think about a moment to discover the trick.
It has more to capture an idea that we can capture a moment.
But what is the trick that makes them seem real?
It's the details or the <unk>
They hate light?
What is the <unk>
Sometimes the illusion is perspective.
But in the end, it's about how to interpret the world and how you can perceive on a <unk> surface.
It's actually not about whether it's realistic but of what we think is realistic.
So I think the foundations are very simple.
I see it as a puzzle of the reality that we take different pieces of reality and put them together to create an alternative reality.
Let me show you a simple example.
Here we have three perfectly <unk> objects, which we can all relate to the three-dimensional world.
But combined you can create something that still looks like <unk> as if it was there.
But, at the same time, we know that it doesn't exist.
So <unk> the brain because the brain doesn't embrace the fact that it doesn't really make sense.
And I see the same process by combining the photographs.
It's really to combine different realities.
And the things that make a picture seem like realistic I think they're those in which we don't even understand the things around us in our daily lives.
But by combining photographs is very important -- because otherwise something will be wrong.
So I would like to say that there are three simple rules that will go to achieve realistic.
As you can see, these images are not very special.
But <unk> can create something like this.
So the first rule is that the combination of pictures must have the same perspective.
Second, the <unk> pictures must have the same kind of light.
And these two images do with these <unk> were taken at the same height and with the same kind of light.
The third point is to make them impossible to distinguish the beginning and the end of the different images with a perfect.
It has to be impossible to see where the image.
Here's another example.
You might think that this is a picture of a landscape and the lower part is <unk>
But this picture is totally comprised of photographs of different places.
In the staff, I think it's easier to create a place that you find out, because you don't need to put in danger the ideas that you have in your head.
But it takes a lot of planning.
And as I thought about this idea in the winter I knew I had several months to find the different locations for the pieces of the puzzle.
For example, the fish was captured on a fishing journey.
The shores of a different location.
The <unk> part was captured in a stone <unk>
And yes, I even made a red <unk> home from the island to look more <unk>
So to make a realistic outcome I think it takes to planning.
You start with a <unk> an idea.
Then you have to combine the different pictures.
And here every piece is very well <unk>
If you make a good job when you take the photos the result can be very beautiful, and you can actually be very beautiful, and you can very realistic.
All the tools are there and the only limit is our imagination.
Thank you.
I'll start showing you a slide on technology, very boring.
So if you can <unk>
It's a diagram anybody who took from a folder of mine.
I'm not very interested in showing you the details but the general aspect of me.
This is an analysis we were doing about the power of <unk> <unk> versus power of local <unk>
The interesting thing about this is that this one, like many other that we tend to see, is kind of a straight line on a <unk> scale.
In other words, every step here represents a order of magnitude on the <unk> scale.
I'm going to talk about technology with <unk> <unk> is something new.
Here's something weird happens.
And that's what I'm going to talk about.
Please turn out the lights.
<unk> more intensity because write about paper.
Why are we <unk> <unk> <unk>
The answer is that if you draw on a normal curve in which, say, these are the years, or a few unit of time, and this would be any measure of the technology that I want to talk about, the diagram would look something ridiculous.
It would be something like this.
It doesn't say a lot.
But if you take for example, for example, any other technology, like transportation, on a <unk> curve, it would be very dumb, we would see a straight line.
But if something like this, it turns out a <unk> change.
If the technology of transportation will be as fast as the past <unk> we could take a taxi and be in Tokyo in 30 seconds.
But it doesn't go back to that rhythm.
There is no <unk> in the history of technological development -- that every few years advance orders of magnitude.
The question I want to argue about is to look at these <unk> <unk> we see that they don't follow forever.
It's not possible to support this change as fast as it goes.
So one of two things.
Or it's going to become a typical curve, I know how this until it comes to something completely different, or maybe I'll do something like this.
That's all it can happen.
I'm optimistic, so I think maybe something like this.
So now we would be in the middle of a transition.
In this line we're in a transition from what used to be the world, in a new way.
So what I'm trying to ask, and I ask myself, what is that new way that <unk> the world?
Why new state is going.
The transition seems very, very <unk> if we are engaged in it.
I remember the future was happening in the year 2000 and people used to talk about what would happen in the year 2000.
This is a conference where people talk about the future and we see that the future remains 2000.
That's all we see.
In other words, the future has been <unk> year after year, throughout my life.
But I think it's because we feel that something is going on.
We can feel a sense of transformation.
And we know that it doesn't have a lot to think about 30 or 50 years because everything is so different than extrapolate what we're doing today doesn't make any sense.
So I want to talk to you about what it might be, how it might be that transition to <unk>
But to do that will have to talk a little bit about things that don't have a lot to do with technology and computer technology.
Because I think the only way to understand it is taking away and look at the long term.
The scale of time that I'd like to do is the time of life on Earth.
I think this image makes sense if we look at every billion years.
So we go back about two and a couple of years when the Earth was a huge <unk> rock with many chemicals that were going to go around them.
If we look at the way that we organized those chemicals we give us a sense of how things happened.
And I think there are theories to begin to understand the origin of RNA. I'm going to tell you a simple version of this and is that, at that time, there were a little bit of oil <unk> with all kinds of chemical recipes inside the inside.
Some of those oil drops had a particular combination of chemicals that made them bring materials from the outside and that drops grew up.
And they started <unk>
In a sense, those were the most <unk> cell shapes -- those <unk> oil.
But those drops were not alive in the current sense, because each one of them contained a random prescription of chemicals.
And every time you were <unk> you have a distribution of chemical <unk>
So every <unk> was a little different.
In fact, the drops of it is being better at the time to bring the chemicals to bring the chemical chemicals -- <unk> more chemicals and <unk> more.
Often they lived longer, they were more <unk>
It was a form of life, and it was very simple, but things are <unk> interesting when these drops learned the trick of abstraction.
In some way that we don't understand very well these <unk> they learned to store information.
They learned to hold information, which was the recipe for the cell, in a special chemical called DNA.
In other words, we <unk> in this meaningless evolution, a writing system that allowed them to register what they were in order to be able to <unk>
The amazing thing is that that writing system seems to have remained stable since it evolved two billion years ago.
Our recipe, our genes, they have exactly the same code, that same writing system.
In fact, every living is expressed with exactly the same set of letters and the same code.
And one of the things I did just by <unk> Now we can write things with this code.
Here I have 100 <unk> of dead powder that try to hide people from the airport.
But <unk> I took this <unk> the code has the common letters that we tend to use in this -- and I wrote my personal data on this piece of DNA and it would take it 10 to 22 times.
So if somebody wants 100 million copies of my personal card -- I have a lot of all the <unk> in fact, for every person in the world and it's here.
If it was a <unk> I would have put it in a virus and have spread it through the room.
What was the next <unk>
Writing DNA was an interesting step.
This made these cells happy about another billion years.
But then another big step happened in which things are very different, and it was that these cells began to exchange and communicate information to form and communicate information from cells.
I don't know if you know, but bacteria can exchange DNA.
So for example, for example, evolved antibiotic resistance.
Some bacteria found the way to avoid penicillin and <unk> them to create their little DNA with other bacteria and now there's a lot of resistant to penicillin because bacteria communicate.
This communication gave place that they would get communities that, in a way, they were together in the way, and a <unk>
So <unk> or <unk> together, or if a community was very successful all the individuals in that community they were getting closer and were <unk> by evolution.
And the inflection point happened when these communities came so long that in fact, they came together and decided to write all the recipe from the community board in a DNA chain.
The next interesting stage for life led to another billion years.
And at that stage, we have communities -- communities of many different kinds of different cells working together as a single organism.
In fact, we are a <unk> community.
We have a lot of cells that don't act alone.
The skin cell is not serves without the heart of the heart, or the muscles -- or the brain, and so on.
So these communities evolved and produce more interesting levels than the phone, which we call a organism.
The next level happened within these communities.
These started <unk> information.
And to build very special structures that they didn't do more than process in community.
It's <unk> structures.
<unk> are the devices that process the information that those mobile communities built.
In fact, they started <unk> within the community being the <unk> structures of <unk> understanding and transmit information.
Those were the brains and the nervous system of those communities.
And that gave them an evolutionary advantage.
Because at that moment as <unk> learning was confined to the duration of an organism, not the period of evolutionary time.
So one organism could, for example, learn not to eat some fruits because he knew bad and got sick the last time he ate it.
That could happen during the life of an organism because they had built these information processing structures that have learned for hundreds of thousands of years by death of individuals who ate that fruit of fruit up.
That's why the fact that the nervous system built those information structures deeply damaged the evolutionary process.
Because evolution could now happen confined to an individual.
It could happen in time to learn.
But then, of course, the individuals found the trick of communication.
So for example, the most <unk> version we know is human language.
If we think about it, it's an incredible invention of it.
I have a very complicated idea, an idea of <unk> in your head.
I'm here sitting here emitting <unk> and hopefully building a similar idea, and <unk> and <unk> in their heads that saved some analogy with mine.
But we take a very complicated thing, we turned it into sound, in sound, and we produce something very complicated in another brain.
That's now allowing us to work as a organism.
In fact, as humanity, we've started to do <unk>
Now we spent by periods similar periods to organisms -- <unk> our methods to record and information processing and information.
For example, the invention of language was a little step in that direction.
The <unk> computer tape <unk> the <unk> and so on. So this is the specialized mechanisms that we now built to handle that information.
And that aggregate us in something much larger, faster and able to evolve more than we did before.
Now evolution can happen.
You saw the <unk> evolutionary <unk> where there was a certain evolution with the <unk> program before our eyes.
And now we've accelerated the time scales over again.
The first stages of the story that told them took a billion years each.
The next few times, the nervous system and the brain, took about hundreds of millions of years.
And so far, the language and so on, took less than a million years.
And next one, like the electronics, it seems to take just a few decades.
The process is <unk> I guess <unk> is the right word to name something that speeds up its own pace of change.
The more it changes, the faster it does.
And I think that's what we see in this explosion of curve.
We see the process <unk>
But I make a life designing computers and I know that the mechanisms that work to <unk> wouldn't be possible without the recent computer advances in it.
But now design objects of such complexity that would be impossible for me to do a conventional way.
I don't know it makes every transistor in that machine <unk>
There are billions.
Instead, with the designers of <unk> <unk> we think of a level of abstraction -- we put it on the machine and the machine with that does something that you don't could, it gets far further and faster than ever before.
In fact, sometimes it uses methods that we don't even understand well.
A particularly interesting method I've been using <unk> is evolution itself.
We put inside the machine an evolutionary process that operates on the scale of daylight.
And for example, in the most extreme cases, we can evolve a program from a random sequence of instructions.
We say, "Please computer, you can run a hundred million instructions to <unk>
You could run these sequences of instructions at random, running all of those programs, and take those who are more <unk> to what we want to do?"
In other words, I define what I want.
Let's say I want to show numbers, to put a simple example.
So we found the programs that are closer to order to order numbers.
Of course, it's unlikely that some random sequences of instructions, <unk> numbers, so none of them did.
But one, luckily, he could find two numbers on the right order.
And I said, <unk> you could take 10 percent of those random sequences.
And we would get those and <unk> to the rest.
And now we have the best ones to bring up the numbers.
And let's go back to a process of <unk> analog to <unk>
Let's take two programs -- that <unk> children, who <unk> <unk> and that children would have the properties of both programs.
So we got a new generation of software programs that had a little bit more successful.
And we say, "Please, repeat the <unk>
<unk> again.
We would have some mutations in it.
And it tries again and it tries to take another generation.
Well, every generation takes a few milliseconds.
So I can do the equivalent of millions of years of evolution in a few minutes, or, in complicated cases, in a few hours.
In the end, we end up with programs that are talking about numbers in absolutely perfect ways.
In fact, they're much more efficient programs than I could have written by hand.
If I look at those programs I can't tell you how they work.
I've tried to show them to see how they work.
They're dark programs.
But they have the <unk>
In fact, I know, I have the safety that they get the goal because they come from a lineage to hundreds of thousands of programs that they did to do it.
In fact, their lives are dependent on to do this.
Once I was going on a 747 with <unk> <unk> and he pulls up a card and says, "Look at this.
He says, <unk> airplane has hundreds of thousands of <unk> who work together to offer a <unk> flight, doesn't make you feel <unk>
We know that engineering processes don't work very well when they become complicated.
So we started to rely on computers to make different design.
And that allows us to produce a lot more complex than the ones that produce normal engineering.
However, we don't understand the whole choices that we are.
In that sense, it's in front of us.
Now we use those programs to make computers faster and so they can perform these programs much more quickly.
So it is <unk>
The thing is getting faster, and so I think it seems so <unk>
Because all of these technologies are <unk>
We're <unk>
And we're at an analog moment to the <unk> organisms when they became <unk>
We are the <unk> and we can't understand what the hell are we creating.
We're at the turning point.
But I think something comes behind us.
I think it would be very arrogant to think that we are the final product of evolution.
And I think that all of us are part of creating whatever it comes from.
But now comes lunch and I think I'll stop here before I was <unk>
I think we have to do something with a part of the medical culture that has to change.
And I think this starts with a doctor, and that's me.
And I've spent enough time enough to let me give up part of my fake <unk> in that.
Before I'm dealing with my talk, we talk a little baseball.
Why not?
We're close to the end of the end, the World <unk>
We love baseball, right?
The baseball is full of amazing statistics.
There are hundreds of statistics.
It's going to be <unk> the <unk> talks about statistics and use them to form a great baseball team.
I'm going to focus on one of them and I hope that many of you know.
It's called <unk>
And we talked about 300 from a <unk> that we <unk>
That means the bat <unk> three of 10 times.
That means throwing the ball into the game of play without being <unk> and whatever it is about <unk> to the first base, it doesn't come to time, and the second base will be <unk>
Five <unk>
You know how they call a <unk> <unk>
Well, you really know, maybe the team of stars.
You know how they call a baseball <unk> <unk>
By the way, this is somebody who is <unk> hit four.
<unk> like legendary Ted Williams, the last player at the League of the League <unk> of <unk> in running more 400 strokes in a regular season.
Now I'm going to take this to my medical world where I feel much more comfortable or maybe less awkward, after what I'm going to tell you today.
Suppose they have <unk> and they have a surgeon who has a surgeon who has a 400 in <unk>
This is not working, right?
Now suppose that they live in a place of place, and a dear thing has two arteries <unk> and his family doctor drifting through a cardiologist whose record in <unk> is <unk>
But you know what?
She's getting so much better.
And the hits have been <unk>
This is not working.
But to ask you.
What do you think should be the average of hits the heart surgeon or a <unk> of a nurse or a <unk> <unk>
Two very well.
And the truth of the issue is that nobody in all medicine knows the hits of a good surgeon, of a doctor or <unk>
What we do, though, is sending them to the world, and I included, with the <unk> of being perfect.
We never, ever make a mistake and try to figure out how to do it well.
That was the message that <unk> when I was in medical school.
I was a spiritual student.
Once a fellow in high school said that Brian Goldman Goldman Goldman Goldman <unk>
It might be.
<unk> in my little <unk> in the nurses of nurses at the General Hospital.
And I learned all of the memory.
From my class of anatomy, I <unk> the origin and the <unk> the <unk> of every artery that comes out of the <unk> and the <unk> and the <unk> and the usual <unk>
And I even knew the differential diagnosis of how to classify <unk> <unk> <unk>
And as much more and more knowledge.
And I was fine, I graduated with <unk>
And <unk> from medical school with the impression that if you were putting it out, then you would know everything, or the most possible thing to all of all, because you get rid of the mistakes.
And it worked for a while, until I met the lady <unk>
I was a resident in a college hospital here, in Toronto, when they brought the lady to the emergency service where I worked.
At the time I was assigned to the service of <unk>
And when I wanted the emergency room to go to a cardiologist I was going to go to that patient.
And to report to the chief of individuals.
When I saw the lady <unk> I was <unk>
I heard a <unk> sound.
And when the <unk> I heard a <unk> sound in both sides of the side -- which was <unk> heart failure.
In these conditions, the heart stops working and, instead of pump the blood forward, the blood goes to your lungs, these are filled with blood, and so there's difficulty to breathe.
And it wasn't hard to <unk>
I did it and I went to work on treatment that I was going to do.
I gave him <unk> and medication to alleviate the pressure in their heart.
I gave him <unk> water pills so that I could eliminate liquid.
And in an hour or two, she started feeling better.
And I felt very well.
And that's when I made the first <unk> he sent her home.
I actually made two more errors more.
He sent her home without talking to the chief of died.
I didn't get the phone and I didn't do what I should have done, which was to call my boss and <unk> with him for him for the <unk>
And if my boss would have seen, I would have been able to bring <unk> information.
Maybe I did it for a good reason.
I might not want to be a resident to be a constant attention.
Maybe I wanted to be so successful and able to take <unk> that I could take care of my patients without even to contact my boss.
The second mistake I made was worse.
At the end of his house, I didn't pay attention to a voice in my head, which said, <unk> is not a good idea. I don't know it.
In fact, I was so insecure that I was asked to the nurse that I went to the lady who went to <unk> "Do you think it's well if he goes to her <unk>
And the nurse thought, and then he said to complete <unk> "Yes, I think being okay."
I remember that as if it was yesterday.
So they signed the high and the ambulance together with the <unk> they took her home.
And I went back to the hospital.
The rest of that day, that afternoon, I had a bad <unk> in the stomach,
But I went on with my job.
At the end of the day, I <unk> to leave the hospital and walked into the parking lot where my car was going to go home. At that time I did something I don't do normally, I don't do.
I went through the emergency emergency service service to home.
And there was another nurse, not the one that I was talking about from the lady <unk> before, but another. He told me three words, those three words that most of the emergency medical doctors are born.
Other specialists fear fear -- but there's a <unk> in <unk> and we see the patients <unk>
The three words are: <unk>
<unk> from the patient who sent his <unk>
I asked the other nurse with complete <unk>
And she said, "Well, she <unk> with the same tone of voice.
She was fine.
But I came back and on the edge of death.
At the time of an hour of having come home, after I was giving him the high school, she suffered a collapse and his family called the <unk> the <unk> who brought them to the emergency room with a <unk> blood pressure <unk> which means a severe shock of it.
I just didn't breathe and blue was blue.
The emergency staff, all its resources.
They gave him medication to climb blood pressure.
And they put an artificial <unk>
I was <unk> and <unk> to the core.
He had a mixture of feelings because after the <unk> was in intensive care therapy and expected all of the hope that they were <unk>
And in the two or three days it was clear that we never had.
It had a <unk> <unk>
The family came together.
And in eight or nine days, it was going to be going on.
And at the ninth day, they let them go. The lady <unk> wife, mother and grandmother.
They say they never forget the names of the ones that they die.
That was my first experience.
And the next few weeks, I was excited about it, and I experienced for the first time the shame that exists in our medical culture, and I sat down alone, <unk> without feeling that healthy shame because you can't deal with your colleagues.
You make peace and you never make that mistake.
It's that shame that leaves a teaching.
<unk> shame I'm talking about is what makes us feel very bad on it.
It's the one that tells us not that what we made was wrong, but we're bad.
And that meant that.
And it wasn't because of my <unk> he was a <unk>
I talked to the family and I'm sure I would get things out and made sure that I didn't care about it.
And I kept getting those questions.
Why did I not ask my <unk> Why did she send her home home.
And in my worst <unk> why I made a mistake so <unk>
Why chose <unk>
Little <unk> that feeling was <unk>
And I started feeling better.
And on one day he was opened up the sky and finally came out the sun. And I wondered if I would feel better again.
And I made a deal with myself where if you were going to get the efforts to be perfect to make any more mistakes, I would make your voices.
And it did.
I went back to work.
It came back to happen.
Two years later, I was an opportunity in the emergency department in a community hospital in Northern Toronto, and I got a <unk> man with a pain in the <unk>
I was very busy and <unk>
And he pointed out here.
I looked into his throat, I was a little <unk>
He was <unk> and he sent him home.
But as he was heading at the door he kept pointing his <unk>
Two days later, when I came to make my family change, my head asked to talk to me <unk> in his office.
And I made three words: remember this?
Remember the patient who saw a pain in the <unk>
He came back and I didn't have a <unk> <unk>
He had a potentially deadly condition called <unk>
You can search for it, in Google. It's an infection, not the throat, but the top, and that can cause the closing of those tracks.
He didn't die.
You know, antibiotics -- antibiotics -- antibiotics -- and they recovered in a few days.
And I went through the same period of shame and <unk> then <unk> and went back to work, until it happened over and over again, and again.
Two times at the same shift in the <unk> not <unk> <unk>
And it's a great effort, especially working in a hospital, because they were 14 patients at the same time.
But in both cases, I didn't send them home and I don't think it's been a <unk>
One of them thought I had a <unk> calculation of them.
I had an X-ray of kidneys, but it turned out, a colleague who was checking into the patient -- some sensitivity in the lower right-hand corner and called the surgeon <unk>
The other patient was with a lot of diarrhea.
I read this liquid order for <unk> and I asked my colleague that I did it.
I went through it, and when you notice some sensitivity in the lower right-hand corner, I called the surgeon <unk>
Both of them were operated and they recovered well.
But every single case I got to me, <unk> me.
But I'd like to tell you that I made the worst mistakes in the first five years of exercise and as many colleagues say, it's a <unk>
The most meaningful ones have been over the last five years.
<unk> embarrassed and <unk>
And here's the problem: If I can't go and talk about my mistakes, if I can't find the <unk> that tells me what really happens, how can I share this with my <unk>
How do I show you this to not make the same <unk>
If I would go into a place like this, I had no idea what you think about me.
When was the last time you heard somebody talking about failure, after failure, after failure?
Of course, at a party you'll hear about the mistakes of other doctors, but you'll not hear someone talking about their own mistakes.
And if I knew and my colleagues as well, that a <unk> in my hospital <unk> the wrong leg -- believe that I would have trouble looking at the eyes.
This is the system that we have.
The total denial of mistakes.
It's the system that there are two <unk> those who make mistakes and those who can't sleep and the ones I know; they have <unk> results and those who have great results.
And it's almost like a <unk> reaction that they start to attack that person.
We have the idea that if we take from medicine to people who make mistakes, we will get a safe system.
But that brings two problems.
In 20 years, about diffusion and medical journalism -- I've done a personal medical research study and errors to learn how possible, from the first article I wrote to the "Star "Star <unk> <unk> <unk> Black House -- white, art.
And what I learned is that mistakes are <unk>
We work on a system where errors happen every single day in which one in 10 drugs <unk> in the hospital are wrong, or <unk> is not correct. In a system where <unk> infections are more and more <unk> causing chaos and <unk>
In this country, they die by 24 Canadian medical errors in the world.
The U.S. Medicine set out 100 <unk>
In both cases, it's about <unk> <unk> because we are not <unk> the problem as we should.
And that's what things are.
A <unk> system where knowledge is multiply every two or three years, and we don't get into us.
sleep deprivation.
And we can't get rid of it.
We have cognitive biases that allow us to make a perfect history of a patient with pain in the chest.
Now, let's take the same patient with a chest pain in your chest, and you come up with <unk> eyes, and I breath with alcohol and all of a sudden, my story was <unk> of contempt.
It's not the same story.
I'm not a <unk> I don't make things always the same.
And my patients are not cars. They didn't get their symptoms in the same way.
For all this, mistakes are inevitable.
So if we take the system like we were <unk> and we eliminate all the professional professionals might be wrong, well, not to be anyone.
And with respect that people don't want to talk about their <unk>
In my <unk> <unk> <unk> art.
And their students were <unk> and they were going to go down the head and put them down and they would start telling their stories.
They want to tell their stories, they want to share them.
<unk> power to say, "Look, don't make the same <unk>
They need a context where we can do it.
They need a <unk> medical culture.
And it begins with a doctor every time.
The <unk> <unk> is human, you know, they accept it, and they're not proud of their mistakes, but it's trying to learn from what happened to teach others.
They take their experiences with them.
It's support for those who talk about their mistakes.
<unk> other people with the mistakes of other people not with the intention of <unk> but in a loving way, and for support for everyone to get away.
And it works in a medical culture that recognizes that human beings run the system, and when this happens, they make mistakes in time.
My name is Brian <unk>
I'm a <unk> doctor.
I'm human, <unk> mistakes.
And I feel a lot but I feel very hard to learn something that can convey to others.
I don't know what to think of me, but I can live with that.
And let me conclude with three words <unk> I remember.
Do you know how many decisions we take a day.
Do you know how much we choose a week?
I recently took a survey over 2,000 people and the average amount of choices that he says to choose an <unk> is about 70 to a day.
Not a lot, in a research followed by a week to a group of presidents of companies.
The researchers recorded all the different tasks of these executives and the time they were trying to make decisions related to those tasks.
They found that, on average, <unk> <unk> jobs a week.
Naturally, every job had a lot of <unk>
Half of those decisions took nine minutes or less.
Only 12 percent required one hour or over his time.
Now think of your elections.
You know how many they belong to the nine minutes, and how many of the <unk>
How do I figure out how to deal with these decisions?
Today I want to talk about one of the biggest problems of <unk> choosing to <unk>
I want to talk about the problem and some possible solutions.
As I talk about this I'm going to ask you a few questions and I need to know your answers.
When I ask a question, like I'm blind, raise your hand only if you want to burn calories.
Otherwise, when you ask a question, if your answer is positive please give you a <unk>
And now my first question of the day, are ready to hear the problem of <unk> <unk>
Thank you.
Being a graduate student at the University of Stanford, <unk> this very, very <unk> supermarket at least at that time was very sophisticated.
It was called <unk>
It was almost like going to a <unk> park.
There were about 250 different kinds of mustard and <unk> over 500 different types of fruits and vegetables and about 25 of <unk> water, and this was when we were made water from the <unk>
I loved going to that store, but on one occasion I asked myself, why do I never buy nothing?
This is the <unk> oil shelf <unk>
They had over 75 different classes, including those who were in <unk> box that came from <unk> trees.
I once decided to visit the manager and I asked her, <unk> this strategy to offer all these <unk>
And he pointed out to me the buses with the buses that came up every day, usually with their cameras.
So we decided to do a little experiment with the <unk> This is the <unk>
hall.
They had <unk> different classes.
You put a post for <unk> right to the shop.
We put it out of six <unk> or 24 flavors of 24 flavors and we look at two things: First of all, what case people were willing to stop to stop the <unk>
More people stopped when I had <unk> that when there were only six, a 40 percent.
We also look at what they were more likely to buy a jar of <unk>
Here's the opposite effect.
From the ones that stopped when there was only three percent of us to buy <unk>
If there were six, we saw 30 percent bought <unk>
If we do the calculations, the people were six times more likely to buy <unk> if they found six. If they were six.
Well, let me decide we can't buy <unk> we probably <unk> it less is good to keep the <unk> but it turns out that the problem of <unk> is affecting us in good decisions <unk>
We decided not to decide, even when this is not <unk>
Now the theme of the day, the financial savings is now.
I'm going to describe a study that I did with <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> where we're looking at the decisions about savings for about a million Americans, from a million American plans in this country.
We were interested in seeing if the number of <unk> available plans for savings plans for loan <unk> <unk> <unk> people to save for the future.
And we found that I actually had a <unk>
We had <unk> plans that went from two, to 59 different options.
And we found that the greater the number of <unk> funds were less participation.
So if you look at the extreme, we see that in the plans that offer two funds, the rate of participation was 70 percent or more, not as high as I wanted to.
And in the plans that we would offer about 60 funding, the rate of participation landed in the 1960s.
It turns out that even if you decide to participate, when there are more choices, even in that case, there's negative consequences.
So for the ones that they decided to participate, the greater the number of choices, more people will be able to avoid actions or investment funds.
In terms there were more options, they were more willing to invest in market financial supply.
But none of these extreme decisions are the ones that we have to do to optimize the future financial well-being.
In the early decade we've seen three main negative consequences by providing more and more possibilities.
The most likely thing is to make the decision, that the <unk> even when it goes against the self-interest.
It's more likely to take the worst decisions in finance and health.
Are you more likely to pick things less <unk> but you see them better.
The main reason is that we have to look at that massive variety of <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> but we are not able to do the calculations in order to contrast it, to contrast and choose that remarkable <unk>
Today I want to give you four simple techniques that we have in one way or another, in different research, so they can try in their business.
The first is, <unk>
You heard it before, but it's never been more true than today, which less is more.
People are always upset when I say, <unk>
They care about losing space in the <unk>
But actually what we're looking at more and more is that if you can cut, to get rid of strange <unk> choices, there will be a sales increase in sales, it's going to be a <unk> better experience.
When I <unk> & <unk> I went from 26 different types of <unk> & <unk> at 15, saw 10 percent increase in sales.
When the Golden Golden <unk> I eliminated eliminated the products for the <unk> of cats who are less <unk> increased <unk> in <unk> for two higher sales and less costs.
You know that <unk> of today, on average, offer 45,000 products.
In a grocery store, there's about 100,000 products.
But the largest store in the world today is <unk> and it offers just <unk> <unk> a kind of tomato sauce on it.
In the world of financial savings -- I think that one of the best examples that have emerged about how to handle the choices is the David <unk> <unk> <unk>
All the Harvard employees are <unk> automatically to a life fund.
Those who really want to choose to choose are 20 funding, not 300 or more.
You know often people say, "I don't know how to <unk>
They're all <unk> options.
The first thing I do is to ask the <unk> the differences there are between those options.
And if their employees can't afford it, they won't be able to do their <unk>
This afternoon, before I started this session, I was talking to <unk>
He told me that he would be willing to offer people in this audience on vacation with everything paid the most beautiful road in the world.
Here, a <unk>
I want you to read it.
I'm going to leave a few seconds for <unk> and then I want you to give you a hand if you're ready to take the offer of <unk>
<unk> <unk> Okay. Anyone who's ready to accept the supply.
They're not more?
Well, I'm going to show you something else.
You knew there was a trick.
Who is ready for that <unk>
I think I really want to hear more hands.
All right.
Actually, you had more information on the first round, than on the second one, but I can tell you that they thought the second time was more real.
Because the images were making it more real.
This brings me to the second technique to handle the problem of <unk> <unk> which is <unk>
So for people to understand the differences between choice, they have to understand the consequences of each option, and that the consequences must be to feel very specific <unk>
Why is people spend 15 to 30 percent more on average when they use credit cards or credit cards that when they use <unk>
Because it doesn't look like real money.
It turns out to make it more real, it can be a very positive tool for people to get more <unk>
We did a study with <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk> staff who worked in <unk> these people were in a meeting where they were being taken into a <unk> plan.
At the meeting of that meeting just like <unk> we did a little <unk>
What we added was that we would tell the staff you would think about the positive things that you would engage in your lives if they save more money.
With this <unk> there was an increase in the <unk> of 20 percent and an increase in the amount that they were interested in saving or what they wanted to place on their <unk> <unk>
The third technique is <unk>
We can handle more categories than choices.
For example, this is a study that we did in a magazine hallway at all.
We saw that in the supermarket <unk> along the <unk> the show of magazines can contain from <unk> different types to <unk>
But you know?
Because my rating tells me how to <unk>
These are two <unk>
One is called <unk> and the other, <unk>
If you think the one on the left is <unk> and the on the right is <unk> give you a <unk>
<unk> <unk> Well, there's a few.
If you think the one on the left is <unk> and the on the right is <unk> give you a <unk>
Well, something else.
It turns out it's right.
The one on the left is <unk> and the on the right is <unk> But you know something?
This rating is totally useless.
The categories must tell you something to you to <unk> not than the <unk>
So you can often see this problem with those huge funds.
I am supposed to be <unk>
My fourth <unk> <unk> complexity.
It turns out that we can handle a lot more information than we think, if we just run it a little bit.
We have to increase complexity itself.
I'm going to show you an example of what I mean.
Let's look at a good decision for a car.
This is a German German manufacturer that allows completely <unk>
You have to take 60 decisions to build the car.
And these decisions vary in the number of choices that offers each one.
<unk> outside of the car. I have 56 possibilities.
<unk> box <unk> four options.
What I'm going to do is vary the order that the decisions.
So half the customers are going to go from lots of choices, 56 colors, to a few thousand boxes.
The other half of customers are going to go from a few choices, four <unk> <unk> lots of choices.
And what am I going to do?
How involved you are.
If you have a default button in every decision, this indicates that they're <unk> or <unk> we're <unk>
We found that the ones that go from many choices to <unk> <unk> the default button over and over again, and another one.
The <unk>
If you go from a few choices to many, you continue there.
The same information, the same number of choices.
The only thing I did was alter the order in which the information is presented with.
If we start with the easy thing, you learn to <unk>
Even though I pick a box of change doesn't say anything about the preferences of inner interior <unk> in all ways we can make you a choice.
We are excited about a product that we're building that now has more <unk> with the process.
To sum up.
I've talked about four techniques to mitigate the problem of <unk> <unk> <unk> eliminate alternative <unk> <unk> to make it <unk> <unk> we can handle more categories with less <unk> <unk> complexity.
All of these techniques that I have showed you were designed to help handle <unk> or better, for you, to use them in their own business, or for people who work.
It's that I think the key to get the best of a choice is being careful the <unk>
And the more careful we are going to be in our better choices to be able to practice the art of choice.
Thank you very much.
In the <unk> East Germany in the East Germany -- if you had a writing machine should be <unk> in the government.
I had to register a piece of text text from the machine.
And this is why the government could track the origin of the texts.
If they found a written <unk> they could track the footprint to the origin of the idea.
In the West we don't think of that somebody could do this, how much that this will be <unk> the freedom of expression.
We would never do that in our countries.
But today, in 2011, if you buy a laser color printer from any big manufacturer and print one page, that page will end up having a few yellow dots on every page that you get on one and your printer.
That's happening today.
And nobody seems to get a lot of fun for this.
This is an example of the ways that our governments are using technology against us, citizens.
And it's one of the three main causes of problems in the network.
If we look at what happens in the online world, we can put the attacks on their <unk>
There are three main groups.
They're <unk>
Like Mr. <unk> <unk> in Ukraine.
The <unk> <unk> is very easy to understand.
These guys make money.
They use <unk> to earn a lot of money, huge amounts of it.
There are really many cases of <unk> online, <unk> that <unk> money with their attacks.
This is <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
This is Alfred <unk>
This is Stephen <unk>
This is <unk> <unk>
These are Matthew Anderson, and <unk> <unk> etc., etc.
These guys are doing their <unk> online, but they do it by illegal means by illegal <unk> to steal money from our accounts when we buy in <unk> or steal our keys to get information from our cards when we buy on a <unk> computer.
The U.S. secret service two months ago, <unk> the Swiss account of this guy, Sam <unk> and this account had <unk> millions of dollars when it was frozen.
Mr. <unk> is <unk> you don't know your <unk>
And I say today is more likely that any of us are a victim of a <unk> that of real crime.
And it's very obvious that this is going to be wrong with worse.
In the future, most crime crimes online.
The second group of <unk> in importance today is not driven by money.
There is another thing that moves, the protests, make motivate you. Do laughter.
<unk> like Anonymous has been <unk> in the last 12 months occupying a role in the online attacks in the line.
Those are the three <unk> criminals who do it for money, the <unk> like Anonymous who do it to protest and the last group are the United States, the governments that are <unk>
And then we see cases like the <unk>
That's a good example of government attack against their own citizens.
<unk> is an authority from the Netherlands, or actually, it was.
<unk> the last fall because of a <unk>
You know, the safety of the site and make a <unk>
I thought last week I said, in a meeting with American government representatives asked one of the leaders if I was <unk> <unk> death of people cause the attack to <unk>
And the answer of it was yes.
So how are people dying of a attack of these?
<unk> is a <unk> authority.
<unk> <unk>
Why are the <unk>
Well, you need if you have a website to <unk> <unk> services like <unk>
Except that <unk> a foreign <unk>
And they were working on <unk>
And in the case of <unk> it happened exactly that.
And what happened in the Arab Spring and those things that have happened, for example, in <unk>
Well, in Egypt, the <unk> protesters based on the secret secret police in April, 2011, and during the <unk> of the building, they found a lot of papers.
Among those papers was this folder called <unk>
And within that folder there were a company based on Germany based on Germany that had sold the Egyptian government tools to intercept a large scale of the U.S. citizens in the country.
They had sold this tool for 280 euros to the Afghan government.
The headquarters in the company is right here.
I mean, Western governments provide the tools for governments to do this to their citizens.
But Western governments are doing this to themselves.
For example, in Germany, just a couple of weeks ago, I found the <unk> <unk> a <unk> used by officials from German government to investigate their own citizens.
If you are <unk> in a criminal case, it's pretty obvious that your phone is <unk>
But this is more there.
You get the connection to the Internet.
<unk> even tools like the <unk> <unk> to infect our computer with a <unk> to allow them to see all media, and to hear the discussions online, to get our data.
When we think carefully about things like these the obvious response to be like, "Well, it seems bad, but it doesn't really affect me because I'm an honest citizen.
Why <unk>
I have nothing to <unk>
And that argument doesn't make sense.
It's in play.
Technology is not <unk>
It's not a question of privacy against safety.
It's about freedom against control.
So if we could trust our governments today in 2011, any right that we would have today, it will be forever.
<unk> <unk> in any future government, in a administration that we could have within 50 years?
These are the questions that have to worry about the next 50 years.
This is where I live. I live in Kenya, in the southern part of Nairobi.
These are the cows of my dad, and the background, and behind the cows, the National Park.
The National Park in Nairobi has no fences in the vast majority of the south, which means that wild animals like they are, they migrate outside the park.
And predators, like the lions, and this is what they do.
<unk> our won.
This is one of those who killed at night, and so soon we wake up in the morning, and we found it dead -- I felt very bad because it was the only <unk> that we had.
My community, the <unk> we think we came from the sky with our animals and all the land for <unk> and so we value them so much.
So I grew up <unk> a lot of the lions.
The dying are warriors that protect our community and won, and they're also mad at the problem.
So they kill lions.
This is one of the six lions who killed in Nairobi.
I think that this is so few in the National Park.
A kid in my community, in the age of six to nine years old, is responsible for his father and this was the same thing that happened to me.
So I had to find a way to solve this problem.
My first idea was to use fire, because I thought the lions were afraid.
But I realized that actually not <unk> because he even helped lions see the pen at a far.
I didn't get <unk>
A second idea was to use a <unk>
I was trying to trick the lions so they believed that it was near the <unk>
But lions are really smart.  They came up the first day and saw the <unk> and the second day, they came back and said, <unk> and they said, this thing doesn't go here.  So they jumped and killed by animals.
So one night I was walking around the pen with a torch and that day lions didn't come from.
I found that lions are afraid of the light that moves.
So I had an idea.
And I got a switch on the way to turn out the lights.
And this is a little <unk> <unk>
It was all about it.
As you can see, the solar panel load the battery and battery <unk> the electricity into the little box <unk> I call it a transformative.
And the <unk> box makes the lights up.
As you can see, the <unk> get out of the outside, because that's where the lions.
And this is how they see that lions when they come from night.
The lights are <unk> and <unk> to lions so that I am walking through the <unk> but I'm sleeping in my bed.
Thank you.
So I put them in my home two years ago, and since then, we never came back to have trouble with lions.
And the neighborhood houses heard the idea.
One of them is from this grandmother.
She had killed a lot of animals that were killed and asked if I could put the lights.
I said yes.
You can see them <unk> You can see the lights are the lights to lions.
Since then, I've installed it in seven houses in my community and they are serving very much.
And my idea is also used now by Kenya, to scare other predators as encodes <unk> and it's also being used by resilience of their farms.
Thanks to this invention, I was fortunate to get a scholarship to one of the best schools in Kenya, <unk> School, and I'm very excited.
My new school now is helping to raise funds and <unk>
I even took my friends to my community and we set up lights in the houses that they don't have, and I show them how to do it.
So a year ago, it was just a kid in the '50s, of the savanna <unk> the cows of my father, and he used to see planes fly, and he said that someday I would be inside of you.
And here I am.
I got the opportunity to come in an airplane for the first time.
My great dream is to get to be a aviation engineer and a pilot when I grow up.
I used to hate the lions, but now as my invention is saving the cows of my dad and to lions, we can be with lions without any conflict.
<unk> <unk> What in my language means, thank you very much.
Chris Anderson: You don't picture how exciting it is to hear a story like you.
So you get a <unk> Richard <unk> Yes.
CA: You're working on other electrical inventions here.
What's the next one on your list?
<unk> My next invention is -- I want to make a close electric CA: A close <unk>
<unk> I know they were already invented electric fences but I want to do mine.
CA: You know, I would take it back once, <unk> and <unk> <unk> I've tried it before, but I had been tried because I got a <unk>  CA: At the end of sleep Richard <unk> you're a big thing.
We're going to be <unk> in every step that I was going to take my friend.
Thank you very much. <unk> Thank you very much.
When I was a small, I thought my country was the best of the planet.
I grew up singing a song called "No <unk>
And I felt very proud of it.
In school, we spent all the time studying the history of Kim <unk> but we never learned a lot about the rest of the world, except that America, South Korea, Japan is the enemies.
Although I was sometimes asking me about the rest of the world, I thought I would spend all my life in North Korea, until everything changed a suddenly.
When I was seven years old, I saw my first public run.
But I thought my life in North Korea was normal.
My family wasn't poor and I was never hungry.
But one day, in 1995, my mom brought home a letter from my sister.
And that said, "When I do this, the five members of the family will stop there in this world, because we haven't eaten the two weeks, past weeks.
We are <unk> together on the floor, and our bodies are so weak, that we're ready to die."
It was very altered.
It was the first time I heard that people were suffering in my country.
When I was walking in front of the train station, I saw something terrible that I can't erase my memory.
A woman without life was dead in the street, holding a child <unk> in his arms watching his mother without being able to do anything.
No one <unk> because they were very concerned about taking care of them and their families.
A huge famine <unk> <unk> North Korea in the <unk>
In the end, over a million North Koreans died during famine and just few survived eating grass, insects and tree.
They also became more and more <unk> the energy, all around me was completely in dark at night except by the lights in the sea in China, just crossing the river from my house.
I always wondered why they had light, and we don't.
This is a picture of North Korea in the night compared to the neighboring countries.
This is the <unk> River, which serves between North Korea and China.
As you can see, the river can be very <unk> in certain points, allowing North Koreans to cross <unk>
But many die.
Sometimes, he saw bodies floating in the river, sometimes.
I can't reveal the details of the North Korea, but I can only say that during the years of famine I was sent to China to live with relatives <unk>
But I just thought I'd be separated from my family for the short time.
I could never have imagined it would take 14 years to go back to live together.
In China, it was hard to live as a young woman without my family.
I had no idea what life would be like as refugee <unk>
But I soon learned that it's not just extremely hard, but also dangerous, because the refugees North Africa were considered illegal <unk>
So I was living with a constant fear that my identity was <unk> and it would be <unk> to a horrible fate back in North Korea.
One day, my worst nightmare was actually done when I was arrested for the Chinese police, and I fell into the police station.
Somebody had been accused of being <unk> then my skills in the Chinese language and asked me a lot of questions.
He was <unk>
I thought my heart was going to blow up.
If it didn't seem natural, it could be incarcerated and <unk>
I thought my life was going to end.
But I managed to control my emotions and asked the questions.
At the end of the <unk> an officer said to another, "This was a <unk> <unk>
And they let me go. It was a miracle.
Some North Koreans are looking for asylum in <unk>
But a lot of people can be arrested for Chinese police, <unk>
These women were very lucky.
Although there were <unk> they were eventually released after a harsh international pressure.
These North Koreans were not so lucky.
Every year, countless North Koreans are captured in China and <unk> to North Korea, where they are <unk> incarcerated or executed in public.
Although I was lucky to escape many other North Koreans not so much lucky.
It's tragic that North Koreans have to hide their identities and fight so hard just to survive.
Even after learning a new language and to find work, all of their world can be done in a second.
That's why after 10 years of hide my identity -- I've been able to <unk> going to South Korea going to the South Korea.
And I started a new life again.
<unk> in South Korea was a much greater challenge than I had expected.
English was very important in South Korea, I had to start learning my third language.
And also, I understood that there was a big gap between North and South.
We are all <unk> but inside, we've come to be very different because of <unk> years of <unk>
I even went through an identity.
I'm a <unk> or <unk>
Where am I? Who am I?
Suddenly, there was no country I could call in my own.
Even though it was going to life in South Korea was not easy, I made a plan. I started studying for the income exam to college.
Just when I was starting to <unk> my new life, I got an alarming call.
The North Korea authorities had a little bit of money that sent my family, and as blame my family was going to be shifted to force to a location in the <unk>
They had to get away.
So I started planning how to help them help them.
North Koreans have to travel long distances on the road to freedom.
It's almost impossible to cross the border between North Korea and South Korea, as well.
So, ironically, I took a flight to China and went to the border of North Korea.
Because my family couldn't speak Chinese, I had to engage in a way, for more than 3,000 miles through China and then through Southeast Asia.
The journey in <unk> took a week, and we were almost caught several times.
One time, our bus was stopped and <unk> by an official police officer.
He asked them all of us all and started asking them questions.
As my family couldn't understand Chinese, I thought my family was going to be arrested.
When the Chinese officer came up to my family, I <unk> I stood up and said that they were <unk> people who were <unk>
I looked at me <unk> but fortunately I believed me.
We did all the way up to the frontier of <unk>
But I had to spend almost all my money to bribing the guards <unk> in <unk>
But even after the border, my family was arrested and incarcerated by crossing the border <unk>
After paying <unk> and bribes, my family was released in a month, in the time.
But the time, my family was arrested and incarcerated again in the capital of <unk>
This was one of the lowest dots in my life.
I did everything to liberate my family, and we were so close, but my family was <unk> in prison a short distance from the South South Korea.
I was going to go and came between the emergency office and the police station, desperately trying to release my family, desperately trying to release my family.
But I didn't have enough money to pay over bribes or <unk>
I lost hope.
At that time, or the voice of a man saying, "What is the problem?"
I was so surprised that a stranger would care to ask.
With my poor English and a dictionary, I told him the situation, and without <unk> the man was the <unk> <unk> and gave me the rest of the money for my family and for another two North Koreans and get them from prison.
I read it with all my heart, and I asked him, "Why do I <unk>
"I'm not <unk> he told me.
"I am helping the village <unk>
I realized that this was a symbolic moment in my life.
The unknown unknown is a new hope for me and for the village <unk> when I was more <unk>
And I showed me that the kindness of strangers and the support of the international community is really the rays of hope that the village <unk> needs.
Over time, after our long journey, my family and I went together in South Korea, to join us.
But achieve their freedom only half the battle.
Many North Koreans are separated from their families and when they go to a new country, they start with little or no money.
So we can benefit from the international community with education, practice language practices and more, and more.
We can also act as a bridge between people in North Korea and the rest of the world.
Because many of us are still in contact with family still inside, and we send information and money that is helping to change North Korea from the inside.
I've been very <unk> I've gotten a lot of help and inspiration in my life, so I want to help North Koreans an opportunity to thrive with international support.
I'm sure you're going to see more and more North Koreans all over the world, including on the TED stage.
Thank you.
I live in the South Center.
This is Center for <unk> shops -- fast food, rapid terrain.
So the city planners came together, and they thought, we're going to change the name of South Center for it to represent something else, so they changed the South L.A. as if this is going to look at what's really wrong in the city.
This is the South Los Angeles <unk>  <unk> <unk> <unk> terrain.
Just like <unk> millions of other Americans, live in a food desert. The Los Angeles South, home from food places to take and eat in the car.
The curious thing is that places of food to take more people than food in the car.
People are dying of <unk> diseases in the Middle Center.
For example, the rate of obesity in my neighborhood is five times more than say, Beverly <unk> which is about 15 miles away.
I think this will happen.
And I ask myself, how would you feel if you didn't have access to healthy food, and if every time you go from home you see the <unk> effects that the current food system has in their <unk>
I see <unk> wheels and sold as a <unk> cars.
I see <unk> <unk> centers like <unk>
And I consider this to stop.
I think the problem is the solution.
The food is the problem and the solution.
I also got tired of driving 45 minutes back to buy an apple that doesn't have pesticides.
What I did, it was plant a food forest in front of my house.
In a strip of land we call a <unk>
It's 45 feet x
The point is, it belongs to the city.
But you have to keep it up.
I said, "Well, I can do what it comes to me, because it's my responsibility and I have to <unk>
That's how I decided to keep it up.
So my group and I, L.A. Green <unk> put us together and we started planting our food, trees -- you know, the nine complete vegetables.
What we do, we are a kind of <unk> <unk> group made by gardeners of all the city and completely voluntary and everything we do is free.
And the garden, was beautiful.
And then somebody will be <unk>
The city on top of me -- and in summary they gave me a <unk> saying that I had to remove my garden, the <unk> was made up <unk>
And I said, "Go on, right?
A court court for planting food on a piece of land that no one <unk>  So I was like, "Well, I was <unk>
Because this time it wasn't going to happen.
<unk> Times had the story written by Steve <unk> and I talked to the <unk> and one of the members of Green <unk> who put a petition in <unk> with 900 <unk> we were a success.
We had the victory in our hands.
My <unk> even called to say that <unk> and <unk> what we were doing.
I mean, why not?
L.A. is the city of the United States with more <unk>
It's 68 miles of <unk>
That's equivalent to 20 <unk>
That's enough space to plant <unk> million plants.
Why does the hell do not look like this?
<unk> a plant will give a thousand, 10 thousand seeds.
When a dollar of <unk> I'll give you 75 dollars.
It's my <unk> when I tell people, <unk> your own food.
<unk> your own food is like print your own money.
You see, I have a legacy for the South Center.
I grew up in there. <unk> my children there.
I would be part of being part of this <unk> reality that was <unk> for me for others, and I'm going to make my own reality.
You see, I'm an artist.
<unk> is my <unk> I am growing my art.
Maybe as an artist of <unk> who was <unk> walls, I <unk> soils, <unk>
I use the garden, the land, like a piece of canvas, and the plants and the trees are my <unk> of that canvas.
It will be <unk> to see what land can do if they let their canvas.
You simply can't imagine how amazing it is a <unk> and how it affects people.
What happened?
I am a witness of how my garden became a tool of education, a transformation of my neighborhood.
To change the community, you have to change the composition of the earth.
We are the land.
It will be <unk> to see how it affects the kids.
<unk> is the most <unk> and provocative act that they can do, especially in a <unk>
In addition, they get <unk>
I remember one occasion, who came a mother and her daughter, were like the <unk> in the night and were in my garden, salt and looked very <unk>
I, well, man, I felt bad that they were there, and I said, you know, they don't have to do this like this.
This is on the street for a reason.
I felt shame to see people who were so close to me, and this just reinforces why I do this, people ask me, <unk> not temes people are going to steal your <unk>
I say, "Oh no, I'm not afraid that you go to <unk>
That's the street.
That's what it's about.
I want the <unk> but at the time, I want you to take your <unk>
There was another time when I put a garden in a shelter to <unk> in the center of Los Angeles.
They were these guys, who helped me download the truck.
It was great, I had given my stories about how this had affected me and how they used to plant with his mom and her grandmother, and it was fabulous to see how the changed changed, so just for a moment.
So Green <unk> has come to plant maybe 20 <unk>
We've had a few 50 people who come from, and they work and <unk> all in a volunteer plan.
If the kids cultivate <unk> the kids will eat <unk>
If you're growing up, you eat <unk>  But if none of these things are <unk> if you don't teach them how food is affecting your mind and your body, eat blind what you put in front of them.
I see young people who want to work, but they have this thing that they are there, I see children in this path designed for them, which doesn't take them nowhere.
With the <unk> I see an opportunity where we can train these kids who are <unk> from their communities to have sustainable life.
And when we do this, who knows?
Maybe there's the next George Washington <unk>
But if we don't change the composition of land, we will never do it.
Now this is one of my plan -- this is something I want to do.
I want to plant a whole block of gardens, where people can share food on the same block.
I want to take ship and turn them into a healthy.
I didn't care about it.
I'm not talking about free things, because the free is not sustainable.
The curious thing about sustainability, is you have to be <unk>
What I'm talking about is to put people out of the street, getting the kids out of the street, who know the joy, the pride and the honor of growing their own food, opening markets from farmers.
What I want to do here, we have to make it sexy.
I want you all to become <unk> -- <unk> gardeners <unk>
We have to change the script of what is a <unk>
If you're not a <unk> you're not a <unk>
That <unk> take their <unk> OK?
That is your weapon of choice.
In <unk> if you want to meet with me, well, if you want to see me, I don't call me if you want to sit in the comfortable chairs and have meetings to talk about making some <unk> to talk about making some shit.
If you want to see me, come the garden with your <unk> so that we can plant something.
Peace Thank you.
Thank you.
<unk>
It's made of <unk> and the asphalt is a good material to drive, but not always, especially in days like today, where it rains a lot.
They can have a huge amount of water in the asphalt that <unk>
And especially if you're going to deal with your bicycle and these cars go out, that's not very nice.
In addition, the asphalt can make a lot of noise.
It's a noisy material, and if we built roads, like in the Netherlands, very close to the cities, we would want a silent road.
The solution for that is to make roads of asphalt <unk>
The asphalt is a material that we use now in most of the roads in the Netherlands, has pores and the water can move through it, so all the water rainwater flow down and will have a road where it's easy to drive, and they don't have no water anymore.
The noise will also disappear into these <unk>
Because it's very far out, all the noise -- so it's a very silent road there.
It also has <unk> of course, and the disadvantage of this road is that you can <unk>
What is <unk> Look at that on this road the stones <unk>
First of a stone, then a number of more and more and more, and so on, and they can not do that.  But they can harm your <unk> and you're not happy with that.
And finally, this can also lead to more and more damage.
Sometimes they can create bumps with that.
<unk> It's ready.
<unk> of course, you can become a problem, but we have a solution.
So here you can actually see how the damage comes into this material.
It's an asphalt <unk> as I said, so it only has a small amount of <unk> between stones.
Because of the <unk> of <unk> light -- this <unk> this <unk> the glue between the <unk> <unk> and if they were <unk> they're going to be <unk> and they will be separate from <unk>
So if you drive the road, you get the <unk> as we saw here.
To solve this problem, we think of <unk> materials.
If we can make this material <unk> then we probably have a solution.
So what we can do is use the steel <unk> of that to clean up <unk> and we can cut the <unk> of steel in very small pieces, and we can mix those little bits with the <unk>
So we have asphalt with little pieces of steel in it.
Then you need a machine, like you see here, that you use to <unk> a <unk> machine.
<unk> can move, especially steel, it's very good at that.
So what you have to do is heat the steel, melt the <unk> the <unk> flow out of these <unk> and the stones will come back back to the surface.
Now I used an <unk> <unk> because I can't bring the great machine <unk> here onstage.
The microwave oven, is a similar system.
I put the exhibition, I'm going to take you to see what happened.
This is the sample that comes out now.
I said we have this kind of industrial machine in the lab to heat the samples.
We tried a lot of samples there, and then the government, actually saw our results, and they thought, "Well, that's really interesting. We have to <unk>
So we gave us a piece of road, 400 feet from the highway <unk> where we had to do a lane of trial to test this material.
So that's what we did there. You see where we were doing the test on road, and then, of course, this road last several years without any harm. That's what we know about practice.
We took a lot of samples from this road and we test them in the lab.
We did aging the samples, we put a lot of burden on them, the length of them, then with our <unk> machine and we put them together and we started it again.
Can we repeat this many times.
Well, to conclude, I can say we've made a material using steel, incorporating these fibers, using the energy of <unk> to actually increase life on the surface of the road, even they can double your life on the surface. It really will save a lot of simple money with very simple tricks.
And now, of course, they are curious about whether this also worked.
We still have the sample here. It's pretty hot.
In fact, it has to cool first before I can show you how to repair it.
But I'm going to do a try.
Let's see. Yes, it worked.
Thank you.
When I was 11 years old, I remember having woken up in an morning with the sound of <unk> in my house.
My father was hearing BBC in his little gray radius.
I had a big smile in his face that was unusual at those times, because the news is generally <unk>
"The Taliban will join me.
I didn't know what <unk> but I could see that my father was very, very happy.
"Now you can go to a <unk> school, he said.
One morning I will never forget.
A real school.
You see, I was six years old when the Taliban were <unk> from Afghanistan and made illegal girls to go to school.
For the next five years, I was <unk> as a child to <unk> my older sister that I couldn't be alone outside, to go to a secret school.
It was the only way we were two to <unk>
Every day, we made a different route so that no one could suspect where they were going.
We had to hide the books in the market bags so that it would seem to be shopping.
The school was at a house, more than 100 of us, in a small room.
It was nice in the winter, but extremely <unk> in summer.
We all knew that <unk> our lives, the teacher, students and our parents.
Every once in a while, school was suddenly a week, because the Taliban <unk>
We always wondered what they knew from us.
They were <unk>
Did you know where it is?
We were <unk> but yet, the school was where we wanted to be.
I was very fortunate to grow in a family where education was <unk> and the daughters a <unk>
My grandfather was an extraordinary man for his time.
A total <unk> of a remote province of Afghanistan. <unk> that his daughter, my mother -- my mother went to school, and so her father would be <unk>
But my educated mother became a teacher.
This is it.
He went back two years ago, just to turn our home home to girls and women in our neighborhood.
And my father, this is the first one of his family to receive education.
There was no doubt that their children had to receive education, even their daughters, despite the <unk> despite the risks.
For him, there was a greater risk in not to educate her children.
During the years of <unk> I remember there were moments when I was very frustrated about our life and was always scared and I didn't see a future.
I wanted to give up, but my father said, <unk> my daughter -- you can lose everything you have in life.
You can steal your money, you can get them to leave your house during a war.
But there's one thing to always be with you, what is here and if we have to sell our blood to pay your education, we're going to do it.
So, you don't want to do it.
I'm 22 years old.
I grew up in a country that has been destroyed for decades of war.
Less than six percent of the women of my age have more than the middle and my family had not been so committed to my education, I would be one of them.
Instead, I find myself proud to graduate in <unk> College at <unk>
When I went back to Afghanistan, my grandfather, who was <unk> for her home to educate his daughters, was one of the first in <unk>
He was not just <unk> from my college degree, but also that I was the first woman, and I'm the first woman, and I'm the first woman, I carry it through the streets in Kabul.
My family believes in me.
I'm a big dream -- but my family has even bigger dreams for <unk>
That's why I'm the global <unk> <unk> a global campaign to educate women.
It's why we <unk> <unk> the first and maybe the only private school for girls in Afghanistan, a country where it's still risky for girls to go to school.
The exciting thing is, I see students in my school with the hard desire to harness the opportunity.
And I look at their parents and their families who, like the mine, <unk> by them, despite the face of a <unk> opposition in front of them.
As <unk> It's not the real name, and I can't show you his face, but Ahmed is the father of one of my students.
About a month, he and his daughter was going on the way from <unk> to his village, and literally become killed by a bomb on the road, for minutes.
When you get to your house, you're the phone -- a voice told you that if I kept sending his daughter to school, they would come back to try.
<unk> already, if <unk> said, "but we will not harm the future of my daughter for their old and <unk> voice.
What I've found out of Afghanistan, and it's something that is often forgotten in the West, is that behind most of whom there is a father who recognized the value of his daughter and he sees that success of her own success.
It doesn't mean that our mothers have not been key to our success.
In fact, often are the first compelling <unk> of the brilliant future of their daughters, but in the context of a society like Afghanistan, we need the support of men.
Under the <unk> the girls who went to school are counting in <unk> remember, was illegal.
But today, over three million girls go to school in Afghanistan.
Afghanistan looks so different from here in the United States.
I find that Americans see the fragility of changes.
You know, these changes didn't last much, after the retirement of the U.S. troops <unk>
But when I go back to Afghanistan, when I look at students in my school and their parents who were putting them out of them, I see a future <unk> and a <unk> change.
For me, Afghanistan is a country of hope and possibilities and <unk> and every day the girls of <unk> I would tell me.
Like me, they dream big.
Thank you.
Never have ever forgotten the words of my grandmother who died in the <unk> <unk> resists <unk> <unk> against him.
But you never get back a revolutionary <unk>
They've spent nearly two years since the <unk> revolution was inspired by the <unk> of mass <unk> both of the <unk> revolution.
A forces with many other citizens <unk> inside and outside of the country to call a road <unk> and starting a revolution against the <unk> regime of <unk>
And it was a great revolution.
Women and young men who were <unk> were in the <unk> <unk> the fall of the regime, are killed by freedom, dignity and social justice.
Have you been shown to the <unk> <unk> <unk>
They've shown a great sense of solidarity from the Middle East, to the west to the south.
Finally, after a six months of the brutal war and some losses from about 50,000 dead -- we managed to release our country and drive to the <unk>
However, <unk> left a heavy <unk> a legacy of <unk> corruption and <unk>
For four decades, the <unk> regime of <unk> destroyed the infrastructure, the culture and the moral structure of society.
<unk> from the devastation and the challenges, I have dear to, along with many other women, rebuild civil society <unk> <unk> a universal transition and just to democracy and national reconciliation and national kilometer.
There were about 200 organizations in <unk> <unk> and immediately after the fall of <unk> about 300 in <unk>
After a <unk> period, I went back to Libya and with a unique enthusiasm -- I began to organize workshops about the development of capabilities and skills leadership skills.
With an amazing group of women founded the <unk> of Women -- <unk> by <unk> -- a movement of women, leaders, very <unk> orientation to advocate for the <unk> autonomy of the woman and by our right state of participation in the building of democracy and peace.
I found myself with a very difficult environment in the <unk> period -- an environment that was getting more <unk> than <unk> of the selfish policies of domination.
Over time, our initiative was approved and successful.
Women won an <unk> of the National Congress in the first elections in 52 years.
However, little bit, the lobby of elections and the revolution as a whole, they were <unk> every day we had the news of violence.
We woke up with the news of the <unk> of mosques and <unk> <unk>
Another day <unk> with the news of the American ambassador and the attack in the <unk>
Another day we woke up with the news of the murder of the London officers of the army.
And every day, every day we woke up with the government of the <unk> and their maternal gay rights copyright rights and their lack of respect for the law.
Our society, made up by a spiritual mindset -- and it has been away from the ideal and the principles of freedom, dignity, social justice, we had at the beginning.
<unk> to <unk> and plateau became the icons of the revolution.
I'm not here today at all of us today to deal with our history of success of <unk> <unk> and the elections.
I'm here today to tell you that we, as a nation, choosing evil, we make the wrong decision.
We don't prioritize well.
Because the choices didn't brought peace, the stability and security is.
The <unk> list and <unk> between candidates and <unk> brought peace and reconciliation <unk>
No, they didn't.
What happened then?
Why our society is still <unk> and dominated by trading policy policies and <unk> so much for men like women?
Maybe what was missing was not only women, but the female values of compassion, mercy and <unk>
Our society needs the national dialogue and creating consensus more than we needed the election -- that just <unk> the polarization and the <unk>
Our nation needs the intellectual representation of the female to need the <unk> and the answer of it.
We need to stop acting as agents of disgust and calling a few days of anger.
We need to start acting as agents of compassion and mercy.
We have to develop a female speech, not just <unk> but also putting it into practice in place in place in the place in the <unk> place rather than the competition, the inclusion instead of <unk>
These are ideal that a Libya, <unk> for war, needs desperately to achieve peace.
Because peace has a <unk> which is about the clearest and <unk> between women's perspectives and <unk>
That's the real <unk>
We need to establish that in an existential way before we do it <unk>
According to a <unk> of the Koran -- <unk> <unk> "is the word of God <unk> <unk> <unk>
At the time, the word <unk> which is known in all the <unk> traditions -- it has the same root in Arabic than the word <unk> <unk> the feminine <unk> and <unk> who comes up with all the humanity that men and women, where all the tribes and all the peoples have been <unk>
And so just like the roofs are completely covering the <unk> that grows inside, the divine matrix of compassion -- all the existence.
This is what it is going to tell us to say, "I think it looks like it looks for all the things."
This is what it is going to tell us to say to us to say it is <unk> on my <unk>
That all of them are <unk> the grace of the mercy.
Thank you.
I'm here today to talk to you today about a crazy question that has an answer as well.
It's about the secrets of domestic violence, and the question I'm going to address is that they all make the usual <unk> Why is it left?
Why would anybody stay with a man who was <unk>
I'm not a psychiatrist, no social worker or a social worker nor an expert in domestic violence.
I'm just a woman with a story to tell.
I was 22 years old. I had just been <unk> at Harvard University.
I had moved to New York by my first job as a writer and an editor at <unk> magazine.
I had my first apartment, my first <unk> American <unk> and I had a very big secret boy.
My secret was that many, many times, the man, that I create my soul <unk> I would join her head with a <unk> <unk> with <unk> <unk>
The man, I loved more than anyone in this world, put a gun on my head and <unk> with <unk> more times than I can remember.
I'm here to tell you the story of <unk> <unk> a psychological trap of love, where every year millions of women, and even some men.
It could even be his story.
I don't look like a typical survivor of domestic violence.
I'm a <unk> at Harvard University, and I have an MBA at <unk> Business <unk>
I've spent most of my career working for companies on the list of <unk> <unk> between them.
I have almost 20 years old with my second husband and we have three children.
My dog is a black <unk> and lead a <unk> <unk> <unk>
So my first message for you is that domestic violence can happen to anyone, all the religions, all the levels of income and education.
It's everywhere.
And my second message is that everybody thinks that domestic violence happens to women, which is a problem of women.
Not exactly.
More than 85 percent of the <unk> are men, and the domestic abuse are only happening in <unk> relationships and <unk> and <unk> or, in the families, the last place where we would want to or we would expect to find <unk> reason why the domestic abuse is so <unk>
I would have told you that it would be the last person in the world that would be stuck with a man who liked him and I was actually a very typical victim because of my age.
I was 22 years old, and in the United States, the women in between 16 and 24 years are three times more likely to be victims of domestic violence than the other ages, and over 500 women and girls of that age are killed every year by partners, <unk> and husbands in the United States.
I also was a typical victim because I knew nothing about domestic violence, their warning signals or their patterns.
I met <unk> in a cold and elite night of January.
I was sitting next to my side in New York City and started <unk> me.
He told me two things.
The first one was he had just been <unk> from a university of <unk> <unk> and I was working on a very important bank.
But what struck me about that first encounter was it was ready and fun, and it seemed like a <unk>
He had some big <unk> like apples, and a <unk> hair, wheat, and it seemed so sweet.
One of the smartest things that made <unk> from the beginning, was to create the illusion that I was the dominant component of <unk>
He did it all over the beginning, in a <unk>
We began to go out and loved all of me that I was list, that I'd gone to Harvard, I would put passion to help girls, and my work.
I wanted to know everything about my family, my childhood, my dreams and illusions.
<unk> believed in me, as a writer and a woman, as no one had ever done before.
And it was why that <unk> in that <unk> school and work on Wall Street and his brilliant future had so much importance to him.
I didn't know that the first phase in any relationship of domestic violence is <unk> and <unk> the victim.
And I didn't know that the second step is <unk>
Now, the last thing I wanted to do was I went from New York to leave my dreams of my dreams, but I thought I had to do sacrifices for your partner, so I would say, "I left my work and <unk> and I went together in Manhattan.
I had no idea that I was falling into a <unk> <unk> which was entering the head of the physical trap and financial and carefully psychological skills.
The next step in the pattern of domestic violence is to put the threat of violence to see how it works.
And this is where they come into the scene of those <unk>
As long as we moved to New England you know, that place where it was supposed to be so sure was that I bought three <unk>
One of them had on the car <unk>
Another one was kept under the pillow in our bed and the third always in their pocket.
And he said that I needed those guns because of trauma that lived in a kid.
I needed them to feel safe.
But those guns were actually a message for me, and even though I had never taken my hand, my life was really serious about danger, every minute of every day.
The first physical attack of <unk> happened five days before our wedding.
It was seven in the morning, and I still had the <unk>
Five days later, when the 10 bruises of my neck had disappeared, I put my phone suit and married me with him.
Despite what had happened. I was confident that we lived happy forever, because I loved her, and he also wanted a lot.
And I was very, very <unk>
I just had a lot of sense of <unk> for the wedding and the fact of making a family with me.
It had been a isolated crash and I would never make it harm.
I spent twice more on our moon for honey.
The first time I was driving up to a secret beach and <unk> and he gave me so strong in the head that I was using several times against the car <unk>
And then a couple of days later, driving back from our moon of honey -- he was going to go through the traffic and threw me a Big Mac on the face.
<unk> kept going down one or twice a week for the next two and a half years of our marriage.
I was <unk> when I thought it was the only one in this situation.
One of three American women is domestic violence or bullying at some point in their life, and the Center for Disease Control reports that every year 15 million children are <unk> 15 million children are <unk>
So, actually, I had very good company.
To go back to my question: Why do I <unk>
The answer is simple.
I didn't know he was abusing me.
Instead, I was a very strong woman, in love with a profoundly <unk> man -- and it was the only person in the world who could help <unk> their <unk>
The other question that everybody does is, why don't you just <unk>
Why not <unk> I could have been at any time.
So for me this is the saddest and painful question that people do -- because to us, the victims, we know something that is normally incredibly dangerous to abandon a <unk>
Because the last phase in the pattern of domestic violence is <unk>
More than 70 percent of domestic violence occur after the victim has been put in end to the relationship, after <unk> because then the <unk> has nothing to lose.
Other lengths include <unk> permanent <unk> even after the <unk> has gone back to marry, <unk> of financial resources, and manipulation of the family court banking system to <unk> the victim and their children, who normally are forced by judges to spend time not with the man who would get to their mother.
And we still keep asking why it's just not doing?
I was able to go, because of one last <unk> I was going to beat my denial.
I realized that the man who loved so much, would have killed me if it was going on.
So I broke the silence.
I told everybody, to the police, to the police, my neighbors, my friends and family, and I am here today because all of you were here today because all of you were <unk>
We have the tendency to <unk> the victims like <unk> <unk> women, <unk> goods.
The question, "Why is it <unk>
For some people in a way of saying, <unk> is it by <unk> as if the victims of the <unk> <unk> <unk> of men who want to <unk>
But since I published <unk> <unk> I've heard hundreds of stories of men and women who also <unk> who learned that they learned a <unk> lesson of what happened to them and to save their lives and happy lives like <unk> wives and mothers, fully free of violence like mine.
Because it turns out that I'm actually a victim and a huge domestic violence in a very typical domestic violence.
I went back to marry a cute man, and we have those three children.
I have that black <unk> and also that <unk>
What I'm going to do is not ever going to go back to it, ever a <unk> gun pointed at my head in the hands of someone who says she wants to me.
Right now, just as you're thinking, <unk> that is <unk> or <unk> what <unk> but all this time I've actually been talking about is you.
I guarantee that there are a few people who are listening to me right now that they're being <unk> or they were being <unk> or they are <unk>
The <unk> could be affecting his daughter, to his sister, to his best friend right now.
I was able to end up in the end of my particular love breaking the silence.
And I keep doing it today.
It's my way to help other victims, and it's my last request to you.
Talk about what you've heard here.
Power is only in silence.
They have the power to end domestic violence simply throwing light on it.
The victims we need all over the world.
We need each of you to understand the secrets of domestic violence.
They were going to play the light on the light of the light with their children, their friends and family and family.
It would take their vision from survivors as fantastic people and <unk> who have a future <unk>
We would find the typical signs of violence to intervene consciously, to slow down their climb and show the victims of a safe <unk>
Together we can convert our beds, our tables and our families in the oasis of safe and <unk> who should be.
Thank you.
Hello. My name is Cameron <unk> and for a while, I am model.
To be precise, for 10 years ago.
And I feel that right now there is a awkward tension in the room because I shouldn't have dressed like that.  luckily, I've brought clothes to <unk>
This is the first change of clothing on a <unk> stage, so you have a lot of <unk> I think.
If some of the women are <unk> when they <unk> they don't have to stand up now, but I'll find it later on Twitter.
I also want to point out that I have the privilege of being able to change what they think about me in just 10 seconds.
Not everybody has that opportunity.
These guys are very <unk> less bad than I don't have to use.
The worst part is to go through this sweater by the head, because it's when you're going to laugh at me, so you don't do anything as you cover your head.
All right.
Why have I done this?
It's been embarrassing.
Well, I hope not as much as this picture.
<unk> is powerful, but it's also <unk>
I have completely changed what they thought of me in six seconds.
And in this picture, I had never had a boyfriend, in real life.
I was totally uncomfortable and the photographer said to me that I would get her back and that <unk> the hair of the kid.
Of course, except with surgery or an artificial space that I made myself two days ago for work, there's very little that we could do to transform our look, which, although shallow and <unk> has a huge impact on our lives.
So today, for me, being brave means to be honest.
I'm on this stage because I'm a model.
Because I'm a nice, white woman, and in my workforce, that's a sexy girl.
I'm going to answer the questions that people always do me, but <unk>
The first question is, how do you get to be model?
And I always say, a <unk> she discovered, but that doesn't mean anything.
The real reason I made a model is because I won the genetic lottery -- and I'm the <unk> of <unk> and maybe you're asking what this is?
Well, in the last centuries we have not only defined beauty as the youth health, youth and symmetry, which are biologically programmed to <unk> also we've associated with a <unk> and <unk> shape, and a white skin.
And that's my future <unk> which I have known to make money.
And I know that there are people in the audience who are now shown <unk> and maybe there are some <unk> in the fashion that <unk> Stop. Here are <unk> <unk> Joan <unk> <unk> <unk>
First of all, the <unk> to know so much about models.
But unfortunately, I have to report that in 2007, a Ph.D. student at the University of New York told each and every one of the models in the <unk> and the <unk> models -- only <unk> -- that is less than four percent, they weren't <unk>
The next question that people always ask me is: Does it be model when it is <unk>
And my first answer is: I don't know, I don't know that.
But then what I would really say to each of these girls is, why? Can you be what you want.
You can be president of the United States, or the <unk> of the next Internet, or a surgeon and a surgeon, and it ninja and poet, which would be awesome, because you'd be the first.
If after this spectacular list is still <unk> No, no, Cameron, I want to be model, then I tell you, I know my <unk>
Because I'm not in charge of anything, and you could be the head of <unk> American magazine or the executive <unk> or the next Steven <unk>
To say most of you want to be model is like saying you want to win the lottery when you be larger.
It's out of your control, it's amazing, and it's not a job that you can choose.
I'm going to demonstrate to you all that I learned in 10 years as a model, because unlike <unk> surgery can be summarized right now.
I don't know what happened there.
Unfortunately, once you take your studies, and you have a pause and a few jobs on your back, no matter what you're going to do, which is to say, if you want to be president of the United States, but you're going to pick people out of inner clothes for 10 years, people are going to get you weird.
The next question that people always ask me is if all the photos are <unk>
And yeah, virtually all the pictures, but that's just a small part of what happens.
This was the first picture that I <unk> and also the first time I used a <unk> and I didn't even have my period.
I know we're going to go into the background, but it was a little girl.
This is how it looked like my grandmother a few months before.
These two pictures are the same day.
My friend came with me.
Here I am at a <unk> <unk> a few days before the pictures for the French <unk>
Here I am with my football team and <unk>
And this is me today.
And I hope you'll realize that I'm not me in those photos.
They are a <unk> group of professionals, photographers and <unk> and all of their <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and they get to create this. That's not me.
Well, the next question that people are always asking me is, do things for free?
I have too many 100 inches long. I have never use, but the privilege before, but the privilege that I get is the ones I get in real life, and that we don't like to talk.
I grew up in Cambridge, and I went to a store and I forgot to take money, and I forgot to take a free dress in it.
When I was a teenager, I was traveling with my friend who was a <unk> <unk> and I jumped out a red <unk> and, of course, <unk> and <unk> an agent -- agent to keep <unk>
<unk> of these privilege -- by my look, not for what I am. And there are people who are paying a price for their aspect of what they are.
I live in New York, and the last year, of the teenagers who stood up and <unk> 86 percent were black and <unk> and most of them were young men.
And there are only <unk> young black people in New York, so for them, it's not a matter of <unk>
But how many times do I <unk>
By looking at this talk, I learned that at 53 percent of 13 year-old girls in the United States don't like their body, and that figure goes down to 78 percent to the 17.
So the last question that people ask me is, how is the life of a role model?
And I think the answer that they expect is: If you're a little bit <unk> and you have the most bright hair, you'll feel very happy and beautiful.
And behind the cameras, we give an answer that maybe you can do it.
<unk> It's really wonderful to travel, and also amazing power to work with creative people, ingenious and passionate people.
And that's all true, but it's just a part of what happens, because what we never say in front of the cameras, what I have never said in front of them, is insecure.
And I'm because I have to worry about it every day.
And if you ever ask yourself, with some more thin legs and the most brilliant hair -- to be happier?
They just have to meet with a group of models, because they have the most bright legs and the most brilliant hair and the clothing -- but they're probably the ultimate women on the planet.
But especially it was hard to look at a situation of racial oppression and gender when I am one of the biggest <unk>
If there's something to keep in this talk, I hope you all feel more comfortable to recognize the power of the picture that we have of success and failure.
Thank you.
The photograph has been my passion since it was most enough to support a camera, but today I want to share with you my 15 <unk> photos and I didn't go to me who the <unk>
There were no <unk> directors and <unk> no opportunity to repeat the photos, not even a minimum of the lighting in the light.
In fact, most of us took tourists tourists random.
My story starts when, <unk> in New York City to give me a <unk> my wife pulled me out this picture holding my daughter on his first birthday. That's the corner of <unk> and the 5.
He took the chance we went back to New York just a year later, so we decided to take the same picture.
Well, you can imagine what comes right now.
When I was approaching the third birthday of my daughter, my wife told me, why don't you take you to New York on a <unk> journey, and you drive the <unk>
So here is when we start to ask the tourists to come up with the photo.
It's amazing that the gesture of delivering the camera to a complete stranger is so universal.
No one has never denied and, fortunately, no one has <unk> the camera.
So we weren't aware of how much life would change this journey.
It became something sacred for us.
This picture is a few weeks after the <unk> and I had to explain to my daughter what had happened that day a five year-old girl could understand it.
These pictures are much more than a concrete moment or a specific journey.
It's also a way to stop time in a week of October and we think about our time and our evolution over the years, and not only at the physical level, but in all the senses.
Because, although we always took the same picture, our perspective changes, my daughter reaches new <unk> and I can see life through his eyes, and how they perceive and interact with everything.
That particular time that we spent together is something we expect with illusion all year.
Recently, in one of the travel, we were walking around, when all of a sudden, it was stopped in the dry and pointed out a red <unk> of the tube store that <unk> small on the previous visits that he <unk>
And I described to me what I felt at the age of five at the same place.
<unk> he remembered their heart <unk> with a force to see that place for the first time nine years ago.
And now what looks at in New York are universities, because he's determined to study in New York City.
And suddenly I understood that one of the most important things we create is the memories.
So I want to share the idea of actively participating in the conscious creation of memories.
I don't know about you, but besides these 15 pictures, I don't go out in many of the family pictures.
I'm always the one you get a picture.
So today I want to encourage you all to come up in the picture, and you don't get to get to someone and say, you get a picture?
Thank you.
I'd like to talk to you about a very special group.
There are 10,000 species of birds in the world.
<unk> are in the <unk> group in the <unk>
First of all, why do they have so bad <unk>
It's also been associated with Disney laughs -- such as <unk> stupid characters.
More recently, if you've been following the press <unk> laughter, applause and <unk> these are the attributes that associated with Parliament <unk> but I don't accept it.
I don't accept it, you know why?
Because the members of Parliament don't keep clean the environment.  The <unk> don't help prevent the spread of disease.
<unk> are <unk>   They're far from <unk>  And my favorite, the <unk> have better presence.   There are two types of <unk> on this planet.
There are the <unk> from the New World who are mostly in the <unk> like the <unk> and the <unk> and the <unk> of the Middle World -- where we have 16 species about these 16, 11 are a high risk of extinction.
So why are the <unk> are important, first of all, provide vital ecological services <unk>
It's our <unk> <unk>
They took the planets to the bone.
They help kill all the bacteria. They help absorb the unless they would stretch and cause huge losses from livestock and diseases in other animals.
Recent studies have shown that in areas where there are no <unk> people take three to four times more time in <unk> and this has huge ramifications of disease.
<unk> also have enormous historical importance.
They've been associated with the ancient <unk> culture.
<unk> was the symbol of the license and the maternity and, along with the <unk> <unk> the unit between the United States and Under Egypt.
At the mythology of <unk> <unk> was the god <unk> and risked his life to save the <unk> <unk> <unk>
In <unk> culture, they are doing some very important <unk> to open up in places like Tibet, there is no place to bury the dead, or wood to <unk> so these <unk> provide a natural elimination system.
What's the problem with <unk>
We have eight species of <unk> in Kenya, which six are at the end of extinction.
The reason is that they're being <unk> and the reason they're being <unk> is because there is conflicts between humans and <unk> <unk> communities use this poison against predators, and as a consequence, <unk> are victims of this.
In South Asia, in countries like India and Pakistan, four species of <unk> are on the critical <unk> <unk> which means that in less than 10 or 15 years <unk> and the reason is because they dropped from the consumption of livestock that has been treated with a drug <unk> like the <unk>
This drug has been banned by using them in India and have taken a statement.
Because there is no <unk> there's been a spread in the number of dogs in <unk> and when you have dogs <unk> you have a huge time bomb, and the number of cases of rage has increased in India.
Kenya is going to have one of the biggest wind farms in Africa, <unk> <unk> are going to be up from Lake <unk>
I'm not against wind energy, but we have to work with governments, because wind turbines do this to birds. They cut them in half.
They're <unk>
In West Africa, there's a horrible trade of <unk> dead to serve the <unk> and the <unk> market.
So what are you doing? Well, we're researching these birds. We are <unk>
We're trying to determine its basic ecology, and see where they go.
We can see that they travel through different countries, so you can focus on a local problem that's not going to be at all.
We have to work with governments at the <unk>
We're working with local communities.
We are talking to them about appreciate the <unk> about the need to appreciate these wonderful creatures and the services that we make.
How can they help? It can become assets, making noise. They can write a letter to their government and tell them to focus on these very <unk> creatures.
When you get out of this room, you're going to tell you about <unk> but talk to their families, with your children, with your neighbors on the <unk>
These are very <unk> Charles Darwin said that he changed because he saw them fly without effort, no energy spending in the heavens.
Kenya, this world, will be much more poor without these wonderful species.
Thank you very much.
Every thing I do and everything I do -- my life has been <unk> for seven years of work during my youth in Africa.
From <unk> to <unk> young people, but I don't.  I worked in Zambia. Kenya, Costa <unk> -- and Somalia.
I worked for an NGO <unk> and every project that we set up in sub-Saharan Africa.
And I was <unk>
<unk> the 21, that Italians were good people, and we were doing a good job in Africa.
Instead of that, everything we would call it.
So our first project, which inspired my first book, <unk> of the <unk> was a project where we just decided to teach people in country to grow food.
So we got with <unk> <unk> to the southern valley to this absolutely magnificent valley that goes down to the river <unk> and we teach the local growing tomatoes and <unk> and ...
Of course, people were not at all interested in doing that, so they were telling them to come to work with, and sometimes they did not <unk>  We were quite amazed that the local in so fertile valley, had no have been done agriculture.
However, instead of asking them how it was possible that we were not going to do -- nothing, we just said, "Thank you to God we're here."  It would take time to save the people of <unk>
And of course, everything in Africa became <unk>
We got these magnificent <unk> In Italy, a tomato would grow this size.
And we couldn't believe it, we were saying to the <unk> "Look at how easy the <unk>
When the tomatoes were beautiful, <unk> and red, at night to the morning, about 200 <unk> appeared from the river and ate everything.  And we said, "Oh my God, my God, the <unk>
And the <unk> said, "Yes, that's why we don't have agriculture here --  "Why don't you <unk> "You're never going to do it."
I thought only of us would have Italians -- errors in Africa, but then, I saw what Americans, they did what the experts were doing and then see what they were doing, and then seeing what they were doing, I felt pretty proud of our project in Zambia.
Because, as you see, at least we feed the <unk>
And then you see the <unk> --  <unk> to see the waste that we would give them to the <unk> people in Africa.
She wants to read a book, read <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
The book was published in 2009.
We, Western donors have delivered the African continent two million dollars in the last 50 years.
I'm not going to tell you about the damage that money has <unk>
Just read your book.
<unk> from an African woman, the damage we've done.
The Westerners are <unk> while, and we treat people just two things: or the <unk> or are <unk>
The two words come from the Latin <unk> <unk> which means <unk>
However, they mean two different things.
<unk> I deal with any of a different culture as if they were my children, "I want you to take you a lot.
<unk> I'm trying all of a different culture as if they were my <unk>
So white in Africa are called <unk>
That book gave me a slap in the face -- "The <unk> <unk> written by <unk> who said about all economic development, if people don't want to be <unk> <unk> alone.
This should be the first principle of help.
The first principle of aid is <unk>
This morning, the gentleman who opened this conference, put a cane on the floor, and he said, you know, you can -- you can just imagine a city that's not <unk>
I decided to have 27 years only to respond to people, and I invented a system called <unk> <unk> where you never start anything, you never make anyone, but it becomes a <unk> of local passion, the <unk> of the local <unk> who have the dream of becoming a better person.
So what do you do this?
You can never get into a community with an idea, and you sit with the people of the <unk>
We don't work from the offices.
We met in a coffee. We met in a bar.
We have zero infrastructure.
And what do we do? We become friends, and we found what the person wants to do.
The most important thing is passion.
You can give you an idea to somebody.
If that person doesn't want to do that, what is going to do you?
The passion that she has for its own growth is the most important thing.
The passion that man has for his own personal growth is the most important thing.
And then we help them find knowledge because no one in the world can be successful alone.
The person with the idea may not have knowledge but knowledge is available.
So years ago, I had this idea: Why not us, for once instead of getting to a community to tell people what to do, for the time, to do not -- but not in <unk>
Let me tell you a secret.
There's a problem with the meetings.
The entrepreneurs will never come in, and they will never tell you, in a public meeting, what they want to do with their own money, what a chance have been able to do with it.
So planning has this blind point.
The smartest people in their community, you don't even know it, because they don't complete their public meetings.
What do we do? We work with us, and we work face face, you have to create a social infrastructure, which doesn't exist.
You must create a new profession.
The profession is the family doctor of the company, the family doctor of the business, which is established with you at home, at the table of their kitchen, and that helps it to find the resources to transform their passion in a way of living.
I started this as a <unk> <unk>
I was doing a Ph.D. in that time, trying to get away from this <unk> garbage where we came to tell you what to do.
In a year, I had 27 projects, and the government came to me to see to ask, "How can you do that?
How can I do it?" And I said, "I did something very, very hard.
And so the government says, <unk>  So the government says, <unk> <unk>  So we've done it in 300 communities in the world.
We have helped to start 40,000 businesses.
There's a new generation of entrepreneurs who are dying of period.
Peter <unk> one of the <unk> business <unk> in history, passed out to '96, a few years ago.
Peter <unk> was a professor of philosophy before I get involved in business, and this is what Peter <unk> <unk> <unk> is actually incompatible with a society and a company <unk>
<unk> is the kiss of the death of business itself.
So now <unk> rebuilding <unk> without knowing what the most <unk> people want to do with their own money and their own energy.
You have to learn how to get these people to come to talk to you.
You have to offer you for me to offer her, and you have to be fantastic to <unk> and then you have to come up with mass.
In a community of 10,000 people, we get 200 customers.
You can imagine a community of 400 people, the intelligence and the <unk>
What do you talk about -- you have a little bit more this morning.
People -- local people. That's what you have <unk>
So what I tell you is that the entrepreneur is in an entrepreneur where it is.
We're at the end of the first industrial revolution, fossils are not renewable <unk> and from one moment to another, we have systems that are not sustainable.
The engine combustion engine is not sustainable.
<unk> as a way of sustaining <unk> is not sustainable.
What we need to think about is how we <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> to seven billion people, in a sustainable form.
There are no technologies to do it.
Who is going to invent the technology for the green revolution, the <unk> <unk>
The government?
They'll be the entrepreneurs and they're doing it now.
There's a wonderful story that was in a <unk> magazine many, many years ago.
There was a group of experts who were invited to debate the future of New York City in the year <unk>
And in the year <unk> they met this group of people, and <unk> about what would happen to the city of New York in 100 years, and the conclusion was the city of New York -- there was not within 100 years.
Why? Because they looked at the curve and <unk> if the population is being growing up to this <unk> to move the population of New York to the <unk> <unk> six million horses, and the manure produced by six million horses that would be impossible to <unk>
They were already <unk> in <unk>  So, in <unk> they were <unk> this dirty technology that was <unk> the life of New York.
So what happens? Over the next 40 years, in 1900, in the United States appeared -- <unk> financial companies <unk>
The idea of finding a different technology was absolutely <unk> and there were very few factories -- factories in <unk> places.
<unk> Michigan.
However, there is a secret to work with the entrepreneurs.
First, you have to offer you <unk>
Otherwise, they won't come to talk to you.
Then, you have to offer you an absolute <unk> service.
And then you have to tell you the truth about <unk>
The smallest company, the largest company has to be able to do three things <unk> the product you want to sell to you has to be fantastic, you have to have a fantastic marketing and you have to have to have a great financial administration.
You know what?
We have never met a single human being in the world that can be done, sell and search for money alone.
It doesn't exist.
This is not born.
We have looked at and look at the 100 Indian Muslim companies in the world -- <unk> <unk>
There is only one thing that every successful companies in the world have in common, only one: no one was started by one person.
And the word was, 32 times.
He wasn't just when he started.
No one begins a company alone.
So we can create the community where we have <unk> who come from a small business environment in <unk> in bars next to their dedicated dedicated bars who will do for you, what somebody did for this gentleman who speaks about this gentleman who speaks to you, what will need?
What can you?
Well, you can <unk> You can look at the <unk>
"Oh, no, I can't do that."
We activate communities.
Thank you.
Those around us can help us in many ways to improve our lives.
We don't know all the neighbors, so we don't find a lot of knowledge in spite of sharing the same public spaces.
In the last few years, I've tried to share more with my neighbors in the public space, with simple tools like putting it out and chalk.
These projects came out of questions like, how much would my neighbors pay for their <unk>
How can we pay for more things without calling the door at a bad moment?
How do we share more memories of our abandoned buildings and better understand our <unk>
How do we share more of our hopes for the empty stores so that our communities can reflect today our needs and <unk>
I live in New <unk> and I'm in love with New <unk>
My soul always finds relief with the giant <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> for centuries and trust a city in a city.
It's always supporting the music.  There's a <unk> in New York --  The city has one of the most beautiful architecture of the world, but also one with the most abandoned American properties.
I live near this house and I thought I could turn it into a more nice space for the neighborhood, and also something that changed my life forever.
In 2009, I lost someone who loved a lot.
It was <unk> as a mother to <unk>
his death was sudden and unexpected.
And I thought a lot about death and a lot.
And this has been a profound gratitude for time and lived in time.
He gave him clarity to the significant things of my life today.
But let me take this look in my everyday life.
I think it's easy to get to catch up the day and forget the really important thing for you.
So with the help of old and new friends transformed the wall of this abandoned house on a giant board and painted on her phrases for <unk> "Before I was dying <unk>
So the <unk> could take a <unk> thinking about their lives and share personal aspirations in the public space.
I didn't know what to wait for this experiment, but the next day the wall was filled with and still <unk>
And I'd like to share some things that people wrote on the wall.
I want to die in die -- I want to be <unk> <unk>  "Before I die of dying, I want to sit on the line of <unk>
I want to die for millions of <unk>
I want to die, I want to plant a <unk>
I want to die out of the <unk>
I want to die once more."
I want to die to go to the rescue of <unk>
I want to die -- I want to be completely myself."
This abandoned space became <unk> and the dreams and hope for people who made me laugh at <unk> and they gave me comfort in moments of times.
It's about knowing that you're not alone. It's about understanding our neighbors in new ways and <unk> it's about giving us the reflection of the reflection and the <unk> and to remember what is the most important thing for us as we grow and <unk>
So this happened last year and I started getting hundreds of messages from passionate people who wanted to make a wall in their community in their community.
So with my colleagues in the civic center we did a kit and now have been done on walls in countries around the world, like <unk> South Africa, Australia, Argentina and beyond.
And together we showed the power of our public spaces if we give us the opportunity to express ourselves and share each other.
Two of the most valuable things we have is time and our relationships with other people.
In our age of cost, it's more important than ever, to have the ways to hold the perspective and remember that life is short and <unk>
death is something that we often avoid talking about, or even thinking, but I understood that we will be ready for death is one of those things that we would have more power.
If you think about death <unk> our life.
Our shared spaces can also reflect what matters to us as individuals and as a community and more means to share hope, fears and stories, the people around us cannot only help improve places, can help improve our lives.
Thank you.
Thank you.
I have a single request.
Please don't tell me I'm normal.
Now I'd like to introduce you to my siblings.
<unk> is 22 years old, and it's very <unk>
Not speech, but it brings joy that some of the best speakers.
<unk> knows what love.
<unk> <unk> pass on what happens.
It's not <unk> It doesn't look at the skin color.
I don't care about religious differences and look at this: it's never <unk>
When I sing songs of our childhood, trying to talk to you the words that I don't even could do, it reminds me of one thing: how little we know about the mind and how wonderful it should be the unknown.
Samuel is 16 years old. It's <unk>
We have the most <unk> memory.
However, it's a selective memory.
It doesn't remember if I stole my <unk> but it reminds me of the year that he came out every one of the songs of my iPod, conversations that we kept when I was four years old, and I pee in my arm during the first episode of the <unk> and the Lady of Lady <unk>
They don't seem <unk>
But most people disagree with it.
And in fact, because their minds don't fit into the concept of normal society, often they're <unk> and <unk>
But what propelled my heart and <unk> my soul was that even if that was the case, although they didn't consider it inside the <unk> that could only mean one thing: they were autistic autistic and extraordinary.
Now, for those less familiar with the term <unk> it's a complex brain disorder that affects social communication, learning and sometimes in physical skills.
In each individual it forms differently, that <unk> is so different to Sam.
And all over the world, every 20 minutes, are diagnosed with a new case of autism, and although it's one of the development disorders that quickly increases in the world, there is no cause for any <unk>
I don't remember my first meeting with autism, but I don't remember one day without him.
I was only three years old when my brother came to the world, and I was very excited to have a new self in my life.
When they spent a few months, I realized that he was different.
It was a lot.
I didn't want to play like the other babies, and in fact, it didn't seem very interested in me at all.
<unk> lived and <unk> in his own world, with his own rules, and I found pleasure in the smallest things, like putting cars around the room, looking at the washing machine and eat whatever there was <unk>
As I grew up, it would become more different, and the differences were made more evident.
But beyond <unk> the frustration and <unk> <unk> there was something really <unk> an innocent nature and innocent nature a child who looked at the world without biases, a human being had never seen.
<unk>
I can't deny that there have been some difficult moments in my family, moments when I would have wish that they were just like me.
But I look back at the things that have taught me about individuality, communication and love, and I realize that they're things that wouldn't want to change by normal.
<unk> is about the beauty that gives us the differences and the fact of being different doesn't mean that one is wrong.
It just means there's a different view of what's right.
If I could give it one one thing to <unk> and to Sam and to you, it would be they don't have to be normal.
It can be extraordinary.
Because, autistic or not, the differences you <unk> are a <unk> Each one of us has a gift inside and honestly, the pursuit of normal, is the last sacrifice of potential.
The opportunity for <unk> progress and change dies at the time we try to be like others.
Please don't tell me I'm normal.
Thank you.
Five years ago, I experienced a little bit of what it must have been <unk> in the <unk>
Penn State asked me a professor of communications, to give me a kind of communication to engineering students.
I was scared.  And I was really scared. Tell me about these students with their great minds, their great books and their unknown words.
But in the developing those conversations, I felt what <unk> must have felt when he fell through the <unk> hole and saw the door of a new world.
So I just sat when I had those conversations with the students. I was surprised by the ideas that they had, and I wanted others to experience this wonderful world.
And I think the key to open that door is a great communication.
We need desperately a great communication of our scientists and engineers in order to change the world.
Our scientists and engineers are the ones that are attacking our larger challenges from energy to environment and health care environment, and if we don't know we don't understand this, and I think it's our responsibility as we don't have these interactions.
But these big conversations cannot happen if our scientists and engineers don't invite us to see their wonderful world.
So scientists and engineers, please, <unk> with <unk>
I want to share some suggestions about how you can do it to make sure that your science is sexy and your engineering is attractive.
First question to <unk> and then what?
So what science is relevant to us.
Don't tell us that you study the <unk> but you study the <unk> that are the mesh structure of our bones because it's important to understand and try and treat it.
And when you're describing their science care with <unk>
<unk> is an obstacle to our understanding of his ideas.
Sure, you can say <unk> and <unk> but why don't you say <unk> and <unk> which is much more accessible to us?
<unk> accessible is not the same thing to make them silly as well.
Instead, as Einstein said, that everything as simple as possible, but not simple.
They can communicate clearly their science without compromise the ideas.
One of the things to consider is to use examples, stories and analogies -- these are ways to connect and engage with their content.
And by presenting their work, forget about signs of <unk>
So you have asked why they're called <unk>  What do they do <unk> The bullets are killed and kill their presentation.
A <unk> like this is not only boring, but it's been supported too much in the area of our brain and <unk> us.
Instead, this <unk> example of <unk> Brown is much more effective, it shows that the special structure of <unk> is so strong that it really inspired the only design of the <unk> Tower <unk>
The trick here is to use a simple phrase -- <unk> that the audience can understand if you lose a little bit, and then provide graphics that we would bring into our other senses and create a deeper sense of understanding what they are <unk>
I think these are just some key ones that can help the other open door and look at the country of the wonders which is science and engineering.
And so scientists and engineers, when you've solved this equation, all the media, <unk> with <unk>  Thank you.
One of my favorite words from all the Oxford Oxford English is <unk>
Just because it sounds very good.
And <unk> means <unk> <unk>
Although there was a <unk> editor of the 19th century that he defined a lot better when he said, "A <unk> is the one who looks for a public charge no matter how <unk> or the beginning, and that when wins it down by the mere use of a monumental <unk>
I have no idea what it means <unk>
So what I do with the words, I guess.
It's very important that words are the basis in politics, and that all politicians know they have to try to master the language.
It wasn't <unk> for example, that the British Parliament would allow the newspapers to quote the exact words to quote in the <unk> camera.
And all of this was because of the bravery of a guy with the <unk> name of <unk> <unk> who was faced at <unk>
He was thrown in the Tower of London and he was <unk> but he had enough courage to face them, and in the end, he had such popular support in London that I won.
And just a few years later we had the first registered use of the phrase <unk> <unk> <unk> like <unk>
Most people think it's literal ...
It's not. It's by a advocate of freedom of expression.
But to show you really how words and policy interact, I want you to go back to the U.S. right after independence.
So they had to address the question of how to call George Washington, their leader.
You didn't know it.
How do you call the leader of a country <unk>
This is going on Congress for a long time.
They submitted all kinds of suggestions that might be <unk>
Some wanted to call it <unk> <unk> and others, "Your <unk> George <unk> and other <unk> from the <unk> of the United States <unk>
Not very <unk>
Some simply wanted to call it <unk>
They thought it was <unk>
And they were not even <unk> they had the idea that you could be picked King by a given term.
And there might be <unk>
Everybody got tired <unk> because this debate was <unk> for three weeks.
I read the newspaper in a poor <unk> and always <unk> <unk> with this <unk>
What caused the <unk> and the <unk> was that the House of concentrated was against the <unk>
The House of the Arab House didn't want to be <unk> of power.
They didn't want to call it to him or to her fund ideas.
So they wanted to give the <unk> more <unk> and more unfortunate ones that were happened.
And that title was <unk>
President. They didn't invent the title. There was just before, but it just meant <unk> that <unk> a <unk>
It was like the president of a jury.
And I didn't have much more <unk> than the term <unk> or <unk>
There were presidents <unk> of small <unk> <unk> and <unk> of government, but it really was a insignificant.
And so the Senate is <unk>
They said, "It's ridiculous, we can't call it <unk>
"This guy has to sign treated and meet with <unk> <unk>
"And who is going to be serious with a title as ridiculous as President of <unk>
And finally, after three weeks of debate, the Senate doesn't work.
We can learn three interesting things about this.
First of all, and this is my favorite way to where I've been able to figure out, the Senate has never been <unk>
President Barack Obama is lucky enough to go out there, waiting for the Senate between action.
The second thing we can learn is that when a government says that a measure is <unk>  <unk> possible for us to go for <unk> years.
But the third thing we can learn, and this is the most important thing, and I want to tell you -- is that the President of President of America doesn't sound as modest today, right?
Especially if you have more than 5,000 nuclear heads <unk> the world's largest economy and a fleet of air vehicles and so on.
The reality and the story has delivered to the title of <unk>
So I won the <unk>
They got the title of <unk>
And also the other concern about the Senate, the appearance of <unk> well, it was an uniqueness back then.
But you know how many nations have now <unk>
And all because they want to sound like the guy who has the 5,000 nuclear heads and so on.
So, at the end of the Senate I won and the House of <unk> <unk> because no one's going to feel humble when they tell you that they're now President of <unk>
And I think that's the great lesson we can learn, and I think that I would like to <unk>
The politicians are trying to choose and use the words to shape and control reality, but really, really change the words that what these might change reality.
Thank you very much.
I'm 45 to the land in a illegal mine in Ghana.
The air is <unk> and dust and it's hard to breathe.
I feel the touch of bodies in the dark, but I can't see much more.
I hear voices that they talk about, but above all, that referred to male <unk> and stones and stones with these primitive tools.
Like each other -- I carry a cheap flashlight of light -- he hired her head with this <unk> <unk> and I can barely distinguish the <unk> branches that hold the walls of that hole that drops hundreds of meters on the ground.
I took my hand and suddenly remember a <unk> I met days before, who lost control and dropped countless feet in that well.
As I talk to you today, these men are at the deep side of that hole in the risk of their life without paying a reward and a often dying.
I went home from that hole and I went home, but they might never do it because they are <unk>
In the last 28 years, I was documenting native cultures in over 70 countries in six continents and, in 2009, I had the great honor of being the only <unk> in the <unk>
Among all the amazing people I met there met there I met a <unk> <unk> the <unk> a NGO who is involved in the modern slavery.
We started talking about slavery and really, I began to learn about slavery because I knew that there was in the world but not about the grade.
When I end up talking about I felt very sad, I honestly had to ignore this <unk> of our days, and I thought, if I don't know, how many people don't know?
He got a stomach <unk> and weeks later, I flew to Los Angeles to meet the director of <unk> the <unk> and offer my help.
So it started my journey to modern slavery.
Interestingly, I had been in many of these places.
A few of them even considered my second home.
But this time, you know, <unk> dirty <unk>
A conservative calculation says that there are more than 27 million people in the world.
It's twice as much as the number of Africans displaced throughout the entire <unk>
150 years ago, the cost of a farmer slave was about three times the annual salary of a U.S. worker.
The equivalent of a few thousand thousand dollars.
And yet, you can tell entire families that are entire families by generations of <unk> <unk>
Amazingly, slavery generates profits from over <unk> 13 billion dollars a year around the world.
Many of them have been <unk> with false education promises and better education to then discover that they're forced to work with not pay, under threat to violence and cannot escape.
Today slavery operates in <unk> the goods produced by slaves have value, but those of them are producing them.
<unk> exists in almost everybody and yet it's illegal all over the world.
In India and Nepal, I met the bricks.
This strange, weird show was like entering the old Egypt or the <unk> of <unk>
<unk> in a <unk> temperature of 54 degrees men, women, women, kids, -- in fact, entire families who were <unk> in a heavy <unk> of <unk> continued to mechanically mechanically ventilated heads, until 18 at the time, and they take them from the <unk> <unk>
<unk> by <unk> and <unk> work in silence, doing this task again and again for 16 or 17 hours a day.
There was no coffee <unk> not to eat and to drink, and the severe <unk> made it <unk>
So <unk> were the heat and the dust that my camera was too warm to the touch and stopped working.
Every 20 minutes I had to run the car to clean up the team and make it work with air conditioning for <unk> and, sitting there, I thought, my camera is getting a much better treatment than these people.
Back in <unk> I wanted to cry but the <unk> that I was on my side of me quickly grabbed me and he said, "You know, <unk> don't do it here."
And I explained very clearly to prove emotions is very dangerous in places like this not just for me but for them.
I couldn't offer you any direct help.
I couldn't give them money, nothing.
I wasn't citizen of that country.
I could put them on a situation worse than they were already gone.
I had to rely on <unk> the <unk> and working within the system for their release and trusted that they would <unk>
In terms of me, I waited to get home to feel my heart <unk>
In the Himalayas, I found children carrying stones for a mile for <unk> <unk> to the <unk>
Those big <unk> were more heavy than the kids who charge them and kids would fill them into their heads with <unk> <unk> made out of <unk> ropes and <unk>
It's hard to witness something so <unk>
How can we influence something so <unk> but so <unk>
Some people don't even know they're slaves and they work 16 or 17 hours a day without <unk> because this has been all his life.
They have nothing to do with it?
When these villagers <unk> their freedom, the <unk> <unk> their <unk>
When you hear the word slavery often we think about sexual traffic and because of this global awareness -- I thought it would be hard for me to work with security in this particular business.
In <unk> I was <unk> women who had been previously <unk>
He led me up to a few stairs which gave this dirty <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
It wasn't exactly a <unk>
It was rather a restaurant.
<unk> as well as they know that they are local for prostitution prostitution by forced prostitution in it.
They have small, private rooms, where the <unk> <unk> with their girls and children, some of the only seven -- are forced to entertain customers and <unk> to buy more food and alcohol.
Each is dark and dirty <unk> identified by a number painted on the wall and divided by a <unk> and a curtain.
The workers often suffer sexual abuse to their clients.
On the <unk> I remember feeling a <unk> <unk> and, at that moment, I could barely imagine what it should be stuck in that hell.
I just had a <unk> the stairs where I was born.
There was no <unk>
There was no big windows like <unk>
Those people don't have <unk> and, because we touch a very difficult issue, it's important to point out that slavery even sexual traffic is going on around us.
There are hundreds of people who are <unk> in agriculture, <unk> in the domestic service, and the list can continue.
Recently, the New York Times reported that between 100,000 and 300,000 children are sold for every year as sex as sex.
It's everywhere, but we don't see it.
<unk> are another activity that often relate to labor <unk>
I visited Indian villages in which there were entire families in the world that were entire families who were <unk> in the raw business.
This is a family.
The black hands of black are the father, the blue and red, of red, of his children.
<unk> <unk> in these big barrels and <unk> the silk in the liquid until <unk> but <unk> is <unk>
My translator told me his stories.
We don't have <unk> they said.
We still hope, yet we can get out of this house someday and go somewhere else where we really pay for our job."
It's estimated that there are over 4,000 children in the <unk> <unk> the largest artificial lake in the world.
When we come, I went to check a quick look.
I saw what seemed to be a fishermen of fishermen on a boat, two brothers, some of the younger kids, some younger children, makes sense of it?
<unk> They were all slaves.
The children are separated from their families who are <unk> <unk> and forced to work <unk> a lot of these boats in the lake, despite not knowing swimming swimming.
This boy is eight years old.
When our boat came up to me was <unk> that her little canoe was <unk>
I was paralyzed by the fear of <unk>
The branches of <unk> trees in Lake <unk> often trap networks and children, <unk> and <unk> and <unk> are thrown into the water to unlock the branches.
Many of them are <unk>
Since it's always been forced to work on the lake.
For fear of his love is not going to run and, like all life has been treated with Atari <unk> it tries the younger slaves under their charge.
I met these guys at five in the morning, when they <unk> the last networks, but they had been working from the one one of the one one of the one of the one one of these <unk>
<unk> and <unk>
And it will really point out that these networks weigh over 400 pounds when they're packed with fish.
I want to introduce you to <unk>
Kofi was rescued in a village village of fishermen.
I met him in a shelter in which the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
Kofi symbolizes
Who will get to be because somebody decided to make a difference in their life?
<unk> by a road in Ghana with partners from the <unk> the <unk> a partner with his journey, suddenly accelerated and <unk> our car and played the window.
They asked us to do it by a way of land to the forest.
At the end of the way, we were going to get out of the car, and he asked the driver to come out very quickly.
Then he pointed out this path just visible and said, "This is the way, this is the path.
And as we started down, we removed the <unk> and we took off the road and after walking close to an hour of the way we found that the path was <unk> by the recent <unk> so I put the photos of photos on my head as they put in these waters to the chest.
After two hours of <unk> the <unk> ended up <unk> in one of course, and we had a mass of holes that could fit in a football field, and they were all filled with <unk> workers.
Many women had children strapped to their backs and, while looking for gold, <unk> in <unk> waters with <unk>
<unk> is used in the process of <unk>
These miners are <unk> in a well part of Ghana.
When they came out of the well they were <unk> in their own sweat.
I remember watching his eyes tired, <unk> because many had been under land for 72 hours.
<unk> are up to 90 feet and these people have been carrying with heavy stone bags that then will be transported to another area where they would get the stone to extract the gold.
At the first view, the site seems to be filled with strong men and <unk> but if we look closer to it, the margin we see other less fortunate and also children.
They're all victims of injuries, and diseases and violence.
In fact, it's very likely that this <unk> ended up like this <unk> victim and <unk> in a few years.
This is <unk> When his father died he took him to work with him in the mines.
By dying his uncle, <unk> I did her debt of the uncle that force the force to be slave in mines.
When I met him, I had worked at the age of 14 and the leg injury that you see here is a product of a crash in the <unk> so serious that doctors say it should be <unk>
In addition to that, <unk> has tuberculosis and yet that, it's forced to work night and day in that mine.
Yet, he dreams being liberated and <unk> with the help of local activists like <unk> the <unk> and this kind of determination, of the face to a remote possibility.
I want to throw light on slavery.
Did you know that your images would be seen by you all over the world.
I wanted you to know that we will be testimony to them and we're going to do everything possible to help change their lives.
I really believe that if we can see ourselves with each other as human beings, then it's very difficult to tolerate atrocities like slavery.
These images are not a magazine -- they're from people, real people, like you and like me, who deserve the same rights, dignity and respect in their lives.
There's no day to happen that I don't think about these very many beautiful people, <unk> that I've had the great honor to meet.
I hope that these images wake up a force in which you see them -- in people like you, and I hope that that force will turn out a fire and that fire <unk> light on slavery because without that light, the beast of slavery can continue living in the shadows.
Thank you very much.
I do math applied -- and there is a peculiar problem for whom <unk> are like the management organization.
Nobody knows what the hell we do.
So today, I'm going to try to explain to you what I do.
And dance is one of the most human activities.
We were <unk> the <unk> of the ballet and the dancers of <unk>  we will see later on.
But spiritual demand is a degree of extraordinary training -- a high level of skill and probably some <unk> <unk> that can well have a genetic component.
Sadly, mental disorders like Parkinson's Parkinson's as Parkinson's disease -- gradually this extraordinary ability as it does with my friend <unk> <unk> who, in his time, was a <unk> dancer <unk>
Over the last few years has been moved through the treatment.
However, there are <unk> millions of people in the world who are sick, and they have to deal with <unk> <unk> <unk> and other symptoms of this disease, so we need tools to detect disease before it is too late.
We need to be able to measure the progress in an objective way, and ultimately, the only way we can know whether there is a cure to be when we have an objective <unk> and <unk>
But it's frustrating that for Parkinson's and other disorders of movement there are no biological markers -- so they don't serve the blood analysis and the best thing we have is a neurological test.
You have to go to a clinic to do that. It's very, very expensive, and that means that, outside of clinical trials, never has been done.
And what if patients could do it at home?
That would save a trip to the clinic. What if patients could be able to get their exam ourselves?
You wouldn't need personal.
By the way, it costs about 300 dollars in the <unk> clinic.
So what I want to talk to you as a kind of <unk> <unk> you see, in some sense, at least, we're all <unk> like my friend <unk> <unk>
This is a video of the vibration from the strings of <unk>
It shows someone healthy as it makes it sounds like by talking. We can imagine as a little <unk> dancers because we need to coordinate all those vocal organs to produce sounds and we all have the genes that we have to do that -- <unk> for example.
And as they did, it requires an extraordinary training.
Let's take a child to learn to talk.
From the sound, we can track the position of vocal vocal as we <unk> and as well as Parkinson's -- it's also affecting the <unk>
On the bottom of the bottom you can see an example of <unk> <unk>
We see the same <unk>
<unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk>
The speech becomes more quiet and <unk> after a while, and this is an example of the symptoms.
How do you compare these tests, based on the voice with the clinical trials -- well, they're both not <unk>
<unk> test is not <unk> they both use the existing infrastructure.
You don't need to design a whole series of hospitals to do it.
Both are <unk> OK, but also <unk> tests are not <unk>
I mean, you can be <unk>
They do very quickly, take about 30 seconds like a lot.
These are low cost, and we all know what happens happens.
When something takes a huge cost so <unk> it comes to massive scale.
These are some amazing goals to <unk>
We can reduce the patient's problems with patients.
It would not do to go to the clinic for the <unk>
high-speed monitoring we could get objective data.
We could make a massive <unk> <unk> for clinical trials and for the first time, <unk> <unk>
We have the opportunity to start looking for the first <unk> of the disease before it's too late.
So when we have the first steps in that sense, we're launching the <unk> Initiative in disease.
Along with <unk> and <unk> we want to register a lot of voices around the world to collect enough data and start to address these goals.
We have local lines for about 750 million people in the world.
<unk> with no disease, you can call it under the price and put recordings for a few cents. And I'm pleased to announce that we've already reached six percent of the goal in only eight hours.
Thank you.   Tom Rielly: So <unk> taking all these samples of, let's say 10,000 people, you can say who's healthy and who isn't it?
What will you get from these <unk>
Max <unk> Yeah, yeah. What happens is that during the call you have to tell you if you have no disease.
<unk> You see, some people can not <unk> it may not be <unk>
But we're going to get a very big sample of data in different circumstances, and to do it in different circumstances is important because we're looking for <unk> the factors of confusion in search of real markers of disease.
TR: You have a precision <unk> at this time?
It takes a lot more than that.
In fact, my student <unk> I have to <unk> it has done fantastic work and now has shown that it works on the mobile phone network too, which we would take on the project. We now have 99 percent accuracy.
TR: <unk> and nine. Well, it's <unk>
<unk> Absolutely.
TR: Thank you very much. Max public <unk>
<unk> Thank you, <unk>
Before March 2011, I was doing <unk> <unk> in New York City.
We are creatures.
We are <unk> in the darkness, in rooms with no windows and we usually avoid sunlight.
We make <unk> models even more <unk> the perfect skin, even more perfect -- we can do it as impossible as possible, and we would get into the press all the time, but some of us are really highly <unk> with many years of experience and a taste true by the images and photography.
On March 11, 2011, I saw from my house, just like the rest of the world, the <unk> events that were going to happen in Japan.
Shortly after that, an organization where he was <unk> there was <unk> <unk> was in the place working as part of the answer.
I, along with hundreds of other volunteers knew that we couldn't stay sitting at home, so I decided to join the group for three weeks.
On May I traveled to <unk>
It's a little <unk> village sitting in the <unk> <unk> of about 50,000 people, one of the first people affected by the wave of it.
The level of water recorded over 24 feet tall and over three miles in the inside.
As you can imagine, the people were <unk>
They were using rubble from the channels and the <unk>
<unk> <unk> We took the slime and we left ready to be <unk> and <unk>
We took tons and tons of dead fish <unk> <unk> from the local factory.
We were <unk> and we loved it.
For weeks, both volunteers like neighbors found similar things.
They found pictures and <unk> photos and cameras and <unk>
Everybody did the same thing.
<unk> and bring them to different places of peoples around the peoples of all around them.
It wasn't until then, I realized that those pictures represented a huge part of the personal losses that those people had <unk>
While they were fleeing the wave, and to save their lives, they had to abandon absolutely everything they had.
At the end of my first week I started to help in a <unk> center of the people.
It helped clean up the toilets, gigantic <unk>
This place turned out to be also the place in the village where the center of <unk> <unk> the photos.
And I had the honor and I had the honor that that day <unk> in me to clean up the photos.
And this was exciting and inspired I had heard the expression from thinking beyond the <unk> but it wasn't until I went through myself as I was connected to myself that something happened.
When you look at the pictures, I found some who had more than a hundred years -- they were still in the lab, I couldn't stop thinking about how to fix that <unk> and repair that <unk> and I knew hundreds of people who could do the same thing.
So that night I entered Facebook contacted some of them, and the next morning, the answer was so overwhelming and positive and knew that we had to try.
So we started <unk> the photos.
This was the first of all.
I was not too <unk> but where the water had <unk> the face of the girl had to get a lot of precision and <unk>
In another way, that little girl would have no aspect of her, and that would be as tragic as I had the <unk> photograph.
Over the time of time, they came through the most luck and they had more <unk> and so it was a little bit more <unk> so he entered Facebook and <unk> and five days later, 80 people in 12 countries were offered to help.
After two weeks I had 150 people out of <unk>
In Japan, in July, we got to <unk> a square town to the north of <unk>
Once in the week we use our scanner in the military <unk> libraries that were <unk> where people were going to reclaim their photos.
The time that <unk> in <unk> is a different story, it depended on the <unk> of the photos.
It could be an hour for an hour. It could be a couple of weeks.
It could be a couple months.
This <unk> had to draw hand by hand using a guide to hand the areas whose color and detail had no <unk>
I took a long time.
The water destroyed all of these photos <unk> in our saltwater, covered in bacteria, with algae -- even oil, all of it along with the step of time I continue to <unk> so it was a major part of the project.
We couldn't afford the picture unless it was clean and dry and <unk> by his <unk>
We were lucky to <unk>
We have the guide of a <unk>
It's very easy to harm even more the photos already <unk>
As once once once said, the leader of my group is like making a tattoo.
You can't make mistakes.
The woman who brought us these pictures were lucky to the photos.
She had started <unk> she itself but stopped when they realized that the <unk> even more.
I also had <unk>
Without them, the images of their husband and their own face was not <unk> we were able to put up the images in a single picture and put it up the whole picture.
When they picked up their photos shared some of their history with us.
A colleagues of her husband found the pictures in a fire station between the rubble of the rubble just far away from where they used to be their house, but his colleagues would get it.
The day of the tsunami, his husband was the experimenter to close the barriers to the wave.
He had to go into the water as the <unk> <unk>
Their little children, not so small now, but their two children were in school in different schools.
One of them was trapped in water.
It took him a week to find all his family and know that everybody was survived.
The day I gave him her pictures his youngest son was 14 years old.
For her, despite all this, those pictures were the best gift I could <unk> something that he could look at, well, something that I could remember from the past that it didn't have been marked on the past day when everything in his life changed or was destroyed.
And after six months in Japan 1,100 volunteers had joined up there -- hundreds of them helped us clean up to hand more than 200,000 photographs -- the great <unk> -- the great majority turned to their own <unk>
More than 500 volunteers all over the world helped us bring back to 90 families -- fully <unk> and <unk>
During this time, we really don't spend more than a thousand in teams and materials, most on ink for <unk>
We take pictures all the time.
A picture is a memory of someone or something, a relationship, a relationship, somebody wanted.
They are <unk> of our memories and stories, the last thing that we would take us, but the first thing we would take to look for.
This is about the project, to restore small pieces of humanity, to bring someone their connection to the past.
When a picture comes back to somebody, it's a huge difference in the life of the person that comes in.
This project also made a big difference in the life of the <unk>
Some of them connected to a little bit larger, will bring something, using their talent for something that are not thin role models.
To finish up, I'd like to read this email that I came back from Japan after six months.
While I was <unk> I couldn't stop thinking about people and the stories shown in the images.
One in particular, a picture with women of different ages from the grandmother to the small girl, gathering around a baby, <unk> me because a similar picture of my family my grandmother, my mother, I and my newborn daughter hangs from our wall.
In the whole world, in all of the very few basic needs -- right?
Thank you.
<unk> <unk> inspired us awe and curiosity with this picture of a bullet going through an apple going through an exhibition in a single inch.
But now, 50 years later, we can go for a million times faster and see the world not a million or a billion, but a trillion frames per second.
I present to you a new kind of <unk> <unk> a new technique so fast that it can create a slow motion of light in motion.
And with that, we can create cameras that can see after <unk> beyond the line of vision, or see the inside of the body without using X-rays and challenging the camera.
If I take a laser laser and I turned on and <unk> in a <unk> or a second or a second or a number of <unk> to create a <unk> package of just a millimeter long.
And that package of photons -- that <unk> travel at the speed of light, and, again, a million times faster than a common bullet is going to be.
If we take that bullet and this package of photons and <unk> in this bottle, how are those photons coming out of this <unk>
What's the aspect of light in <unk>
Now, all this is --   Remember that all of this happens in less than a <unk> is what it takes to travel the light.
But this video is 10 billion times slower so you can see light in motion.
Coca-Cola is not <unk> this research --  -- <unk> a lot of things in this <unk> <unk> this information to show what's going on.
The pulse, our <unk> comes into the bottle with a photons of photons which starts to <unk> and that, inside, it starts <unk>
Part of the light goes on the table, and we started seeing these <unk>
Many of the photons eventually get to the cap and then explode in various directions.
As you can see, there's a bubble of air that bounces inside the inside.
At that time, the waves travel on the table and because of the insights on the top of the top you see in the bottom of the bottle, after several boxes, that the insights are <unk>
Now, if we take a common <unk> and we do it to go through the same distance and we see it in slow motion at about 10 billion times, how much you think it would take us to see that film?
A day? In fact, a week?
It would be a very boring film --  of a slow bullet in motion.
And how about trying to test nature <unk>
You can see the waves that are <unk> from the table, the tomato table, and the wall of the background.
It's like throwing a rock on a pond.
It's the way nature paints a picture, I thought about a <unk> at the time, but of course, our eyes see a composition of.
But if you look at more and more this <unk> you'll realize that, as the light is <unk> it's still <unk>
Why? Because the tomato is <unk> and the light breaks inside and it turns out after several <unk> of second.
In the future, when this <unk> is in your mobile phone, you're going to be able to go to the supermarket and check if the fruit is grown without having to <unk>
So what do we create this camera in kindergarten.
Like photographers, you know, if we take a photo to low exposure, it comes very little light up.
But we're going to go to a billion times faster than the <unk> <unk> so I will just go into some light.
We sent that <unk> that package of photons, millions of times, and we recorded over and we recorded over and over again with a very <unk> <unk> <unk> and we took those data <unk> and the <unk> <unk> to create those <unk> that I showed you.
We can take all of those data in raw data, and it's kind of interesting.
Superman can fly.
Other heroes can become invisible,
And if a new power of a future <unk> would allow him to see after the <unk>
The idea is that we could throw a little bit of light on the door. They will go into the room, a part is going to be reflect on the door, and from there to the camera.
So we could extract those multiple <unk> of light.
It's not science fiction. We've already built it.
On the left is our <unk>
Behind the wall there is a dummy and <unk> light on the door.
After the publication of our article in Nature <unk>
And a small fraction of photons will go back to the camera -- but interestingly, in slightly different times.
And as we have a camera that works so fast, our <unk> has unique abilities.
It has very good time resolution and it can look at the world at the speed of light.
So we know the distances up to the door and also even the hidden objects, but we don't know what point it corresponds to how a distance.
By projecting a laser you can record a <unk> photograph that you see on the screen, really doesn't make any sense.
But we will take a lot of images like this, dozens of images, the <unk> and we're going to try to look at the multiple <unk> of light, and with that, we can see the <unk> object.
Can we see it in <unk>
This is our reconstruction one.
We have things for us to explore before we get this out of the lab, but in the future, we could create cars that are <unk> <unk> with what's back to the curve, and it's going to be <unk>
Or we could look for survivors in dangerous conditions by looking at the light reflected by open windows or open light.
Or we could build <unk> capable of seeing inside of the body for <unk> and the same for <unk>
But of course, because of the tissue and the blood -- this is quite hard, so actually this is a asked scientists to start thinking about <unk> as a new mode of visualization to solve the problems of operating in the next generation.
Just like <unk> <unk> he was a scientist, and it became science in art, a art of photographs, <unk>
I realized that all the <unk> of data that we collected every time is not just for scientific humanity, but we can be able to be able to be able to get a scientific humanity, but we can be able to be able to be able to have scientific humanity, but we can be able to be able to do some of the data <unk>
And creating a new form of computer photography with a slow motion and color code.
And let's look at those waves. Remember, the time between each of those waves is just a few thousand <unk>
But here it also happens something fun.
If we look at the waves under the <unk> these are going to go away from us.
The waves should move towards us.
What happens here?
It turns out, as we're recording almost at the speed of light, we have strange effects -- Einstein would have loved to see this image.
The order in which the events happen in the world sometimes comes into the camera.
We have the corresponding challenges of space and time, we can correct this <unk>
It's time. Thank you.
Hello. This is my cell phone.
A mobile phone can <unk> life, and gives you individual freedom.
With a mobile phone can <unk> a crime against humanity in Syria.
With a mobile phone, you can tweet a protest in Egypt.
With a cell phone you can record a song, it will go to <unk> and make it famous.
This is all possible with a cell phone.
I'm a <unk> of 1984 and live in the city of <unk>
Let's go back to that moment, to this city.
So here you can see how hundreds of thousands of people would come up with a change.
This is the fall of 1989. Imagine if all of these people set out to make them look for a change, had a cell phone in your pocket.
Who are having a cell phone here?
<unk>
Raise your mobile <unk>
<unk> An expert, a Blackberry, wow!
It's pretty much all of you have a cell phone.
But today I'm going to talk about my cell phone, and how it changed my life.
I'm going to talk about this.
These are 35 <unk> of information.
<unk> raw data.
Why is that information there?
Because in the summer of 2006, the E.U. Commission presented a <unk>
<unk> <unk> <unk>
This directive says that every European phone company, every street company from all Europe, has to store a broad range of information from users.
Who calls <unk> Who sends an email to <unk>
Who sends a text to <unk>
And if we use the mobile phone, where we are.
All of this information is stored for at least six months, and to two years, in their phone company or his Internet provider or the Internet.
And in all Europe, people stood up and said, "We don't want this."
They said they didn't want this data.
We want the <unk> in the digital age, and we don't want the phone and the Internet providers -- all this information about us.
There was lawyers, journalists, priests, everybody said, "We don't want this."
And here you can see about 10,000 people who came out to the streets of Berlin and they said, <unk> not <unk>
And some of them said that this would be the <unk> 2.0.
The <unk> was the secret East <unk>
And I also asked if this really works.
You can store all this information about us?
Every time you use the <unk>
So I asked my phone <unk> <unk> <unk> that at that time, I was the largest telephone company in Germany, that please give me all the information they had about me.
I asked them once, and I went back to myself, and I didn't get a concrete answer. It was all <unk>
But then I said, I want to have this information, because you are <unk> my life.
So I decided to make a court demand because I wanted to have this information.
But <unk> <unk> said no, we won't give you this information.
At the end of it, he <unk> an agreement.
<unk> the demand and send me the information that I <unk>
Meanwhile, the Court <unk> <unk> failed the <unk> for the German law of the E.U.
So I got this ugly little bit of brown with a CD inside.
And in the CD there was this.
Thirty and five thousand <unk> 30 lines of information.
When I first saw it, I said, well, it's a huge archive OK.
But after a while, I realized that it's my life.
There's six months of my life on this archive.
It was a little bit <unk> what should I do with that?
Because you can see where I am, where step night, what am I doing.
But then I said, I want this information <unk>
I want to make it <unk>
Because I want to show people what the data <unk> means.
So, next to <unk> <unk> and Open City, we did this.
This is a six months visualization of my life.
You can get closer and I'll go backwards and forward.
You can see every step I do.
And you can see how I'm going from <unk> to <unk> and how often I call it the way.
This is all possible with this information.
That's a bit of fear.
But it's not just about me.
It's all of us.
First of all, there are things like, I call my wife and she's called, talk a couple of times.
And then they call me some friends and they call me among them.
And then one calls the other, and the other one on the other, and we end up with this big communication network.
You can see how your people communicate with each other to what time they call to each other, what time to sleep.
You can see all this stuff.
You can see the centers, the leaders of the group.
If you have access to this information, you can see what's doing the society.
If you have access to this information, you can control its society.
This is a model for countries like China and Iran.
This is a model to study the shape of your society, because you know who talks to whom, who send him an email to who, all of this is possible if you have access to this information.
And this information is stored at least six months in Europe, and to two years.
As I said at the beginning, imagine if all these people in the streets in Berlin, in the fall of 1989, they had a cell phone in your pocket.
And the <unk> had known who I was involved in this protest, and if the <unk> would have known who the leaders, this would never have happened.
The fall of the Berlin Wall may never have happened.
And as a result, neither of the <unk> <unk>
Because today, state agencies and companies want to store as much information from us as possible in and outside the web.
They want to have the ability to follow our lives and they want to do it forever.
But <unk> and living in the digital age, is not a contradiction.
But today you have to fight for the <unk>
You have to fight for that every day.
When I go home to their friends who privacy is a 21st century value and not just that fashion.
When you go home, you get to your representative who just because business and state agencies can store some information, you don't have to do it.
And if you don't believe me, ask your phone company, what the information you store from you.
So in the future, every time you use their mobile phones that are given to you to remember they have to fight for the <unk> in the digital age.
Thank you.
Hi right, what happens?
It's not enough.
Hi right, what happens?
I call it <unk> <unk> and I'm not <unk> but I know the doctor who brought me the world.
I was going to take my mom six times in six different directions. They were going to poor in the process.
As a result, I have cerebral <unk> that's why we <unk> all the time.
<unk>
It's <unk> I'm like a mixture of <unk>
And Muhammad <unk>
The P. C. It's not genetics.
It's not <unk> and it can be <unk>
No one <unk> the uterus of my mother and not <unk> because my parents were brothers, but they are.
It's just about accidents, like the one that happened at birth.
Now, I'm going to tell you, I'm not an inspiration. And I don't want any of you to present them.
I feel bad for me, because at some point in life, you've just wish to be <unk>
Let's go for a ride.
<unk> <unk> are in the shopping center, and they drive into circles, and what do you see?
16 places empty <unk>
And think, "God, I can be at least a little bit <unk>
Also, I tell you, I have 99 problems, and the P. C. It's just one of them.
There will be a <unk> of the <unk> I would win the gold medal.
I'm a <unk> and a woman, and I am alive and live in New Jersey.
If you don't feel better, maybe you should do it.
I'm in Park <unk> in New Jersey.
I always loved that my neighborhood and my illness had the same started.
I also love that if I wanted to walk from my house in New York, I can.
A lot of people with brain paralysis not <unk> but my parents don't believe in <unk>
The mantra of my father was, "Can you get a <unk> <unk> <unk>
If my three older sisters <unk> I <unk>
If my three older sisters went to the public school, my parents would get to the school system, and they were <unk> that I was like, and if we didn't take all of the top note -- all the <unk> my mother.
My father taught me to walk to the five years putting my <unk> in his feet and just walking.
Another approach I used to be used was hang a dollar in front of me to do it.
The <unk> which I carry in was very strong and ...
Yeah. The first day in the kindergarten was walking like a <unk> champion who had received a lot of <unk>
By growing up, there were only six Arabs in my city and were all of the family.
Now there are 20 Arab -- and it's still all of the family.  I think no one realized that we weren't <unk>
This was before 9/11, and that politicians would think appropriate to use <unk> to <unk> as a campaign.
People who grew up had no problems with my faith.
But nevertheless, it seemed to be a lot of hunger that died of hunger during the <unk>
I told them that I had enough fat to live three months without eat, so I <unk> at dawn at 16, and it's very easy.
<unk> <unk> in <unk>
Yeah, in <unk> It's crazy.  My parents couldn't afford the physical therapy, so I sent me to the dance school.
I learned to dance with <unk> or I can walk with <unk>
I'm from New Jersey, and there we want to be <unk> so if my friends used <unk> I was too.
And when my friends were going to spend the summer vacation on the coast of Jersey, I didn't go.
I spent my summers in a war zone, because my parents were afraid that if we were not going to go back to Palestine all the <unk> we were going to get in <unk>
On the summer vacation of summer often my father was trying to <unk> so I was drinking milk from <unk> to put me warm cups on the back, and I was going to get myself on the <unk> Sea, and I remember the water and I was like, <unk> <unk>
But the <unk> cure it was yoga.
I have to say it's very boring, but before I do <unk> it was an comedian of <unk> that he couldn't stand up with <unk> <unk>
And now I can put it in your head.
My parents came up with this idea that I could do anything, that no dream was impossible, and my dream was to be at the <unk> Hospital Hospital.
I went to college with positive discrimination and I got a scholarship to the <unk> University of Arizona, because it was in all the <unk>
It was like the <unk> <unk> of the theater.
And all of me will be <unk>
I did all the tasks of the least smart, I took the ultimate note in my classroom, and also in their classes.
Every time I did a scene from the glass zoo my professors <unk>
But I never got a piece of paper.
Finally, in my last year, the <unk> decided to make a work called <unk> very slowly in Jackson.
It's a work of a girl with <unk>
I was a girl with <unk>
So I started screaming at the four <unk> <unk> <unk>
I have <unk> <unk>
At the end of it, we would go back to <unk>
Thank God <unk> I finally am <unk>
I didn't get the paper.  They gave him <unk>
I went to <unk> to the director of the theater, crying cry historically, as if somebody would have killed my cat, to ask him why and she told me because they thought I could not do the risk stunts <unk>
And I said, <unk> if I can't do the scenes of risk, you can't do the <unk>
It was a role that literally had been born and gave him to an actor without cerebral <unk>
The university was imitating my life.
Hollywood has a <unk> history of <unk> actors without disability for disabled papers.
When I did, I went home, and my first tour, spin <unk> was like an extra <unk>
My dream became true.
And I knew that it would be <unk> <unk> <unk> friend in a <unk>
Instead, I was there as a <unk> I didn't see myself as a <unk> and it was obvious to me that the directors of <unk> are not <unk> actors -- not white, with disability.
It's just going to be perfect people.
But there were exceptions to the rule.
I grew up watching <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and all these women had one thing in common: they were <unk>
So I made it <unk>
In my first tour, I took a famous book in New York to New Jersey, and I will never forget the face of the first painting he took when she fell at high speed on the highway in New Jersey with a driver who had <unk>
I worked in <unk> across the United States, and also in Arabic in the Middle East, without censorship and <unk>
Some people say I'm the first <unk> of the Arab world.
I never like to reclaim the first place, but I know that you never heard that little rumor that says that women are not fun, and they find very fun.
In 2003, my brother from another mother and father, Dean <unk> and I launched the <unk> <unk> <unk> in New York, now on his 10.
Our goal was to change the negative image of the <unk> in the media and to remind you of the CEOs that <unk> and <unk> are not <unk>
<unk> to Arabs was much easier to fight the challenge of stigma stigma
My great opportunity came in 2010.
And I was like invited to the cable show of cable that has Keith <unk>
I walked as if I was to graduate school dance to a studio and sat up in a wheelchair.
I looked at the director and I said, "You can give me another <unk>
She looked at me and said, <unk> four, three, <unk>
And we were in <unk>
So I joined the desk desk in order to not go out of the screen during the <unk> and when I finished the interview, I was <unk>
I finally had my opportunity and the <unk> I knew they wouldn't come back to me.
But not just Mr. <unk> came back to <unk> but he was like <unk> and <unk> and pasted my chair.
So a fun thing I learned in direct with Keith <unk> was that people on the Internet are <unk>
It's said that children are <unk> but they never had a little girl and a little bit higher.
Suddenly, my disability on the Internet became a <unk> object.
I had video clips online with comments like, "Why do you <unk>
"It's <unk>
And my favorite <unk> <unk> terrorist <unk>
What disease does it have?
We really should be pray for her."
A piece suggested I even suggested my disability to my <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
<unk> is so visual as race.
If somebody in a wheelchair can't do <unk> then <unk> can't make someone in a wheelchair.
The <unk> are <unk> Yes, <unk> man.
<unk> are the largest minority of the world, and the most <unk> in the world of entertainment.
The doctors were saying that I don't know -- but I'm here in front of you.
However, we have grown up with media, I don't think it <unk>
I hope that together we can create more positive images of disability in media and everyday life.
Maybe if there were more positive images, that was less hatred on the Internet.
Or maybe not.
Maybe we still need all the society to teach our children.
My <unk> journey has taken me to very spectacular places.
I came to <unk> the red carpet <unk> by the <unk> Susan <unk> and the <unk> <unk> <unk>
I came to act on a film with Adam <unk> and working with my <unk> incredible Dave <unk>
<unk> the Arab world has become <unk>
I was <unk> in the arts state of New Jersey in the <unk> of 2008.
And I started "The <unk> of <unk> a charity to give kids refugee children -- a tiny bit of what my parents would tell me.
It was the only time my father saw me in alive, and I do this talk to his memory.
<unk> <unk>
I call it <unk> <unk> and if I can, you can.
I'd like to tell you a story about a small town.
I don't know his name, but I know his story.
She lives in a small town to the South <unk>
This village is near <unk>
<unk> drives to poverty and the edge of the <unk>
Without it, it goes to the big city, in this case, <unk> the capital of Somalia.
When it comes there, there is no opportunities, there is no job, no future <unk>
He's just living in a tent in the city outside of <unk>
After maybe a year <unk> nothing.
One day you read about a man who offers him to <unk> him after dinner, <unk>
He knows a group of people, who gives you a break.
It gets a little bit of money to buy new clothes -- money to send home to his family.
They present to a young woman.
And then finally home.
It starts a new life.
It has a life goal.
A beautiful day in <unk> under a blue sky, <unk> a bomb.
That kid from that little town with dreams of the great city was the <unk> terrorist -- and that dynamic group of people were in the <unk> a connected organization with the Qaeda.
So how about a little kid in a small village trying to fulfill his dreams in the city ends with him <unk>
He was waiting for it.
He was waiting for an opportunity, waiting to start their future, waiting for a future, and this was the first thing that he arrived.
This was the first thing that pulled him out of what we call <unk> <unk>
And his story is repeated in urban centers around the world.
It's the story of the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> riots in <unk> <unk> riots in London, looking at something beyond the <unk> of <unk>
For the young people, the promise of the city, the great dream of the city is the opportunity for jobs, for well-being, but young people don't participate in the prosperity of their cities.
It's often the youth that suffer from higher unemployment.
By 2030, three of five people living in cities will be under 18 years.
If we don't include the young people in the growth of our cities, if we don't give them any opportunities, the history of <unk> <unk> the door of access to terrorism, to the <unk> will be the story of anonymous cities.
And in my city of birth, <unk> 70 percent of the young people are <unk>
70 percent don't work, it's not going to school.
They don't do anything.
I went back to <unk> last month, and I went to visit the <unk> Hospital.
I remember in front of that hospital <unk> to <unk> thinking, and if I had never gone?
And if I had been forced to be in that same <unk> <unk>
I would have become <unk>
I'm not really sure the answer.
The reason I was in <unk> that month was actually to harbor some young leaders in a business set.
It was about 90 to 90 juvenile leaders.
We sat down, and we had an rainfall of ideas on solutions to the major challenges facing the city.
One of the young people in the room was <unk>
He was at the University of <unk> <unk>
There was no job, no opportunity.
I remember when he said to me, because it was a graduate graduate college college was the perfect white white guy for Al <unk> and other organizations to be <unk>
They were looking for people like it.
But this story takes a different way.
In <unk> the biggest obstacle to point A to B is the streets.
<unk> years of civil war have completely destroyed the road system, and a motorcycle can be the easiest way to do.
<unk> saw an opportunity and <unk>
He started an <unk> company.
She started <unk> blind to local residents who normally couldn't afford them.
I bought 10 <unk> with the help of his family and friends, and his dream is at some point to expand hundreds of <unk> over the next three years.
Why is this story?
What does this different different?
I think the ability to identify and leverage a new opportunity.
It's the corporate spirit and I think that business spirit can be the most powerful tool against <unk>
It will be the creators of the economic opportunities that are looking for so much.
And you can train young people to be entrepreneurs.
I want to talk to you about a young man who attended one of my meetings, Mohamed <unk> a <unk>
I was <unk> to train some of the young people at the height of business initiative and how to be innovative and how to create a culture of business <unk>
In fact, it's the first <unk> that <unk> has seen over 22 years, and until recently, until Mohamed came, if he wanted flowers for your <unk> <unk> we were from plastic since abroad.
If you ask somebody, "When was the last time you saw <unk>
For those who grew up during the civil war, the answer is, <unk>
So, Mohamed saw a chance.
He started a company of <unk> and <unk> design.
I created a farm outside of <unk> and he started growing <unk> and <unk> who would survive the hard climate <unk>
And it started the delivery of flowers and it started creating gardens in houses, and the city companies -- and now it's working in the creation of the world's first public park in 22 years.
There are no public parks in <unk>
She wants to create a space where the families, young people, can go together, and like he says, smell the pink pink <unk>
By the way, he doesn't cultivate pink because they use a lot of water.
So the first step is to inspire young people, and in that room, the Mohamed had a really profound impact on young people.
They had never thought about starting a business.
They had thought about working for an NGOs, working for the government, but their story, their innovation, really had a strong impact on them.
They forced them to look at his city as a place of opportunity.
I encouraged them to believe that they could be entrepreneurs, that they could be <unk> of change.
By the end of the day, they had innovative solutions for some of the biggest challenges facing the city.
<unk> business solutions for local problems.
So, inspire young people and creating a culture of business spirit is really a big step, but young people need capital to make their ideas happen.
They need expertise and orientation and guidance to <unk> and set out of their business.
It was going to young people with the resources that they need, <unk> the support that they need to move from conception to creation, and create <unk> for urban growth.
For me, the business spirit is something more than to start a business.
It's creating a social impact.
Mohamed not simply selling flowers.
I think it's selling hope.
His Park, this is how it's called, when it's called, when it is created, transform the way people see their city.
<unk> hired children on the street to help rent and keep <unk> for him.
It gave them the opportunity to escape about <unk> <unk> <unk>
These young people are having a tremendous impact on their cities.
So my suggestion is, to become the young people in entrepreneurs, <unk> and eating their <unk> innovation, and they will have more stories about flowers and Parks than <unk> and <unk> of <unk>
Thank you.
I was about 10 years old, and I went to <unk> with my dad in the <unk> <unk> area in the <unk> area in New York City.
It was a beautiful day.
The <unk> forest.
The sun would make the sheets like a <unk> and not to be on the way that we could -- we could almost pretend we were the first human beings to step on that land.
We got to our camp.
It was a shed in a <unk> with a beautiful Lake <unk> when I discovered something horrible stuff.
Behind the shed there was a <unk> of about four square feet with an apple <unk> <unk> balls of aluminum <unk> and <unk> old <unk>
And I was <unk> I was very angry and incredibly <unk>
The <unk> who were too lazy to get out of what they thought they thought was going to clean up their <unk>
That question went on with me, and it was <unk> a little bit.
Who clean our <unk>
No matter how to <unk> or where do we <unk> the <unk> who clean our trash in <unk>
Who clean our trash in Rio or Paris or <unk>
And here in New York, the Department of <unk> is the <unk> for <unk> and <unk> tons of waste and two billion tons of products -- every day.
I wanted to meet as individuals.
I wanted to understand who does that work.
What does it feel like to use the uniform and take that <unk>
So I started a research project with them.
I traveled in the trucks and walked on the back and I interviewed people in offices.
I needed to go into more.
So I started working like <unk>
Now I didn't just travel in the trucks. I would have the <unk>
And operated the mechanical ones and the snow.
It was a remarkable privilege and an amazing learning.
They all ask the smell.
It's there, but it's not as precious as you believe, and in the days that it is very strong -- you have a very strong one.
It costs a lot of people used to weight.
I met people who had worked on it for several years, and their bodies were still kept by the weight of taking on their body tons of trash every weeks.
It's also the danger.
According to the Bureau of FBI <unk> <unk> waste is one of the most dangerous <unk> of the country, and I learned why.
You're coming out and moving into the traffic all day and go through all the day by all the day and go down all around you.
You just want to make it, so in general the driver is not paying attention.
That's very bad for the <unk>
And also the garbage itself is full of dangers that often fall out of the truck and make terrible damage <unk>
I also learned about the relentless of trash.
When you get out of the <unk> and you see a city from the back of the truck, you get to understand that the garbage is like a force of nature itself.
Never stop coming.
It's also a way of breathing or circulation.
It should always be in motion.
And it's also stigma.
It seems to me that stigma is especially ironic because I believe that <unk> waste are the most important work hand on the streets of the city, for three reasons.
They are the first license of public health.
If you don't get rid of the waste in the efficient way and effective every day, this starts <unk> from their <unk> and their dangers inherent in very real ways.
So we had <unk> for decades and centuries come back and begin to <unk>
The economy needs it.
If we can't get rid of the old one, we have no space for what the engines of economy start to fail when it's endangered the consumption.
I'm not advocating for capitalism, just pointing its relationship.
And then there's what I call our average average speed necessary.
I mean simply at the speed that we used to move to move in the <unk> time.
We don't usually have any <unk> we don't have to clean it or we have our cup of coffee, our bag of water.
We use, the <unk> we forgot about them, because we know that there is a work force on the other side to be able to do it.
So today I want to suggest today a couple of ways to think about waste collection that maybe help reduce the stigma and put it into that conversation about how to design a sustainable and human city.
Her work, I think, is almost <unk>
You're on the street every day, <unk>
They use a uniform in a lot of cities.
Do you know when they look like?
And their work allows us to do our own.
They're almost a way of relief.
The flow that keep us with us except for ourselves, of our own <unk> our <unk> and that flow is always going to stay in one way or another.
One day after the 11th of September 2001, I heard a <unk> truck truck in the street, grabbed my little boy and I went down the stairs and there was a man doing his paper flow as he did all the <unk>
And I tried to thank you for doing his work that particular day, but I started crying.
And I looked at me and just <unk> and said, "We're going to be okay.
We're going to be okay."
Shortly after that, I began to investigate waste collection and I went back to see that man.
It's called <unk> we work together and we did good friends.
I want to believe that <unk> was right.
We're going to be fine.
But in our efforts to <unk> the way we exist on this planet as a species we should include and having all the costs, even the very real human cost of labor in work.
The municipal waste is what we think about when we talk about trash account for three percent of the amount of waste in the nation.
It's a remarkable statistic of it.
So in the flow of their days and their lives, the next one you see someone whose work is to clean up the garbage of you, <unk> a moment to <unk>
You know, a moment to tell you very much.
My work focuses on the connection of thinking about our community life, forming part of the environment where architecture is born naturally from conditions and local traditions.
I brought two recent projects like this.
Both projects are located in emerging countries, one in Ethiopia and the other in Tunisia.
They share the fact that different analysis of different perspectives become an essential part of the end of architecture.
The first example started with an invitation to design a commercial center.
This is the kind of construction that showed us as an example, to my team and me, about what we had to design design.
At first, the first thing I thought about was, "I want to go out <unk>
After seeing some of these buildings there are many in the city we realized that there are three important aspects to <unk>
In principle, these buildings are almost empty because they have very large stores where people can't afford to buy things.
Second, you need to use a lot of energy because the coating with crystals generates heat inside, so you need a lot of <unk>
In a city where this shouldn't happen because it comes to a temperate climate that goes from 20 to 25 degrees throughout the year.
And third, it doesn't have anything to do with Africa and with Ethiopia.
It's a very rich place in culture and traditions.
In our first visit to Ethiopia, I was really fascinated with the old market that is the open air structure where thousands of people, go and buy things every day to <unk>
There's also that idea of using the public space to generate external activity.
So I thought, that's what I really wanted to design, not a commercial center.
But the question was how to build a modern building, of several stories applying these principles.
The next challenge was presented to looking at the site -- which is located in a much growth area of the city, where much of the buildings that we now see in the image, not yet.
And in addition to two parallel streets, they don't communicate in an extension of hundreds of feet.
So the first thing we did was to create a connection between these two streets, putting all the inputs from the building.
And it spreads with an <unk> <unk> which creates a space to the open air in the building that was <unk> by its own shape, and the rain.
And around this space, we have applied the idea of the market with small businesses, which changes on each floor because of the form of space.
I also thought, how to close the building?
I wanted to find a solution that would be <unk> to local climate conditions.
And I started thinking about a similar tissue to a concrete <unk> <unk> to allow the air to <unk> and also a <unk> way.
And then we were inspired by these beautiful buttons in the dresses of <unk>
They have properties of fractal geometry and this helped me model the <unk>
We're building that with these little pieces of <unk> which are the windows that leave the air and light in a way inside the building.
This is <unk> with these little colors of colors that use light inside the building to illuminate the building at night.
With these ideas it wasn't easy to convince developers because they thought, "That's not a commercial center -- it wasn't what we want.
But ultimately we all realized that this market idea was going to be much more profitable than the mall because at the end of accounts there were more local to sell.
And also the idea of the <unk> was a lot more economic -- not just because of the material compared to the glass, but also because it wasn't necessary to have the air <unk>
So we got certain savings in the budget that we use to implement the project.
The first thing was to think about how to achieve the energy <unk> for the building in a city where electricity is cut down almost every day.
So we get a great advantage by putting <unk> on the roof.
And then under those panels we think about the ceiling as a new public space with areas of meeting and bars that would create this oasis of city.
And these <unk> on the roof, they collect water to the face of the inside.
It's expected for the beginning of the next year, because we go through the fifth floor.
The second example is a master plan of apartments and services in the city of Tunisia.
And to make a big project, the biggest thing I have designed, I needed not only to understand the city of Tunisia, but also its environment, its tradition and culture.
During that analysis, I put special attention on the <unk> a structure of a thousand years old -- that was surrounded by a wall with a dozen <unk> doors with almost straight.
When I went to the place, the first design operation we did was to expand the streets existing -- creating 12 early blocks in size, and the features that there are in sophistication and other cities in Europe with these <unk>
In addition to that, we select some points in relation to the idea of the <unk> doors with straight lines, and this changed the initial model.
And the last operation was to think of the cell, the little cell of the project, like the apartment, as an essential part of the master plan.
I thought, what would be the best orientation for an apartment in the <unk>
And it's <unk> because it creates a thermal difference between both sides of the house and so a natural improvement.
So I would have a scheme to make sure that most apartments are perfectly <unk> in that direction.
And this is the result of a combination of the European block and the Arab city.
It has these blocks with <unk> and then in the low plant we have all the connections for density.
And it also responds to local standards that make greater density at higher levels at higher levels and a lower density in the ground plant.
And it also reinforces this idea of the doors.
The roof, which is my favorite space of the project is almost like taking into the community that was busy by building space.
It's where all the neighbors, can go up and make activity like running a two miles in the morning, or jump from one building to the other.
These two examples, have a common approach to design process.
And also, they're in emerging countries, where you can see cities literally growing.
In these cities, the impact of architecture in life of people changes communities and local economies at the same pace as buildings.
For this reason, I see even more important to look at architecture looking for simple solutions, but <unk> that improve the relationship between the community and the environment and that they have as an objective to connect nature to people.
Thank you very much.
When I was eight years old, a new girl joined our class. It was as remarkable, as you see all the new girls.
He had huge amounts of very brilliant hair, and a little bit of <unk> <unk> was super strong for the capitals of the states, very good for <unk>
And I ended up that year, and I was full of jealousy, until I was <unk> my generic plan.
One day I got a time after the output of school. It was a little afternoon, and I hid in the bathroom <unk>
When the coast was <unk> I walked into the classroom, I took my teacher on the table of grades.
And then, I did.
I would look at the ratings of my <unk> just a few like this.
All the same.  And I signed up to return to the book in <unk> but to see, some of my other colleagues had very good notes as well.
So in a <unk> <unk> the notes around the world, without any imagination.
And I put all rows from <unk> and I was just a row out of it, just to be there, because <unk>
I'm still surprised what I did.
I don't understand how the idea.
I don't understand why I felt good at it.
I felt important.
I don't understand why I never will.
So it was all the obvious <unk>
I never helped me.
But most of all, I <unk> the reason why I was bothered by this little little girl, so small, so small to <unk>
I <unk> the jealousy.
They're so <unk> and so <unk>
We know babies suffer from jealousy.
Also the primates. The tiles are very <unk>
We know that <unk> are the number one cause of spouses in the United States.
And yet, I've never seen a study that would be <unk> or the long duration or the sadness.
So you have to go to the fiction, because the novels, are like the lab that you study <unk> in all their possible shapes.
In fact, I don't know if it is an exaggeration to say that if there were no jealousy, <unk> I would have never literature.
Well, I wouldn't have <unk> the <unk> wouldn't have <unk>
There was no king <unk> or <unk> and <unk>
There would be no Shakespeare.
<unk> the high school lists of high school, because we would be losing "The <unk> and the <unk> wouldn't have <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk>
Without jealousy, there is no <unk> I know it's fashionable to say that <unk> has the answers for everything, and in terms of how much it has all of them.
This year is 100 years away from his work -- <unk> <unk> the most <unk> study of sexual <unk> and also the ordinary <unk> and so -- everything we might have.  And thinking about <unk> we have the details -- right?
We think about a child trying to reconcile the dream.
We think about a <unk> <unk> in <unk>
We forgot how hard that image.
We forgot how relentless it is.
I mean, it's about books that Virginia <unk> said they were as hard as <unk>
I don't know what the cat, <unk> but we assume it's <unk>
Let's see why they go so well together, the novel and the <unk> the <unk> and <unk>
It's going to be very obvious as the jealousy, that you get to the person, your wish, for their <unk> are a good narrative of <unk>
I don't know. I think we got very close to bone, when we think about what happens when we feel jealousy.
When we feel dynamism we tell ourselves a story.
A story about other people's lives, and those stories make us feel terrible because they're designed for that, to make us feel wrong.
Being a <unk> and audience, we know exactly what details to put the <unk> right?
The <unk> do all novelists <unk> and that's something that <unk> understood it.
All that she does to me to give me pleasure could be able to be able to be able to be able to make another one, maybe right now."
And it starts to say to itself that story, and since then, <unk> says that every <unk> they <unk> it detects in his lover, he adds it to his collection of instruments of torture in his private camera.
You have to admit that <unk> and <unk> were notoriously <unk>
You know, the <unk> <unk> would have to abandon the country, if they wanted to break up with it.
But you don't have to be so <unk> to recognize that it's hard work. Right?
<unk> are <unk>
It's a <unk> emotion <unk>
And how are the <unk>
<unk> <unk> from information.
<unk> use the details.
<unk> like large amounts of brilliant hair, and the cute little <unk> <unk>
The <unk> are <unk> from the photos.
This is why Instagram is so successful --  <unk> links right to the language we have to do with the jealousy.
When you <unk> it's in your courtship agony -- soon listening behind the doors and <unk> to the <unk> of his lover -- then regardless of those behaviors.
He says, "Look, I know that this is <unk> but it's not different from the interpretation of an old text or looking at a <unk>
He says, "It's really scientific research with real value.
<unk> is trying to prove that the <unk> look <unk> and they make us seem <unk> but in their <unk> they are search for the truth, a really painful truth, in fact, to what <unk> <unk> the more painful the truth.
The pain, the <unk> the <unk> These were the <unk> of <unk>
He says, "A woman who we need, who makes us suffering with us a whole range of much more profound and vital feelings that a wise man can be <unk>
It's telling us we're going to look for women <unk>
No. I think it's trying to say that <unk> tells us ourselves.
And there is some other emotion that makes us <unk> this particular way.
There's some other excitement to us, our <unk> our horrible ambition and our <unk>
Some of the other excitement that teaches us to look at similar intensity <unk>
Freud would write about this later.
One day, Freud was visited by a very <unk> young man who was being used with the idea that his wife would be <unk>
And Freud said that there was something weird in that man, he didn't get into what his wife was doing.
So she was <unk> everybody knew it.
The poor creature was under suspicion without any cause.
But he was looking for things I was doing his wife, without realizing it.
<unk> <unk> or actually accidentally <unk> with a man?
Freud said that the man was becoming the <unk> of his wife.
The novels are really good at this.
The novels described very well how the <unk> are going to look at intensity but no precision.
In fact, the most intensely <unk> we are, more we become <unk>
And for this reason, I think, the <unk> take us to make violent acts or illegal acts of the <unk>
<unk> are helping us behave in the whole ways that are totally <unk>
Now I'm thinking of myself at the age of eight years, <unk> but I'm also thinking about this story that I heard in the news.
One of 52 years of 52 years old was captured by having created a fake account.
For one year, a year.
She was trying to join the new girlfriend of his former Mayor <unk> I have to say that when or this, I reacted with <unk>
Because let's be realistic.
How big if you were creativity. Right?
It's like <unk>
Like a novel <unk> novel.
<unk> is one of my favorites.
She's a very strange little bit of the American literature.
This is the author of <unk> in a <unk> and "The <unk> Mr. <unk> books that try to figure out how ideas get rid of our minds, and once we are in the sphere, in the kingdom, the membrane that it might be, can be <unk> in a second.
Let's take Tom <unk> his most famous character.
Tom <unk> goes from <unk> or wanting what you have to get out of your self and <unk> from what you ever <unk> and it's under the <unk> <unk> your name, takes your <unk> cow accounts.
It's a way.
But what do we do? We can't take the route of Tom <unk>
I can't give you <unk> all over the world, both as I wanted to.
It's a shame, because we live in times of envy.
We live in jealousy.
I mean, we're good for social media, where the coin is <unk> right?
Health show us <unk> I'm not sure.
So we're going to do what the characters always do when they're not sure, when they're in a mystery.
Let's go to the <unk> <unk> and ask for <unk> <unk>
When people think about <unk> thinking about <unk> <unk> in Professor <unk> that criminal genius.
But I've always tried <unk> <unk> <unk> the head of <unk> <unk> <unk> who needs <unk> <unk> needs the <unk> genius, but it bothers it.
Oh, I was so <unk>
<unk> needs its help, but it was <unk> and <unk> and <unk> in the every one of the puzzles.
But as they work together, something starts to change, and finally in "The <unk> of the Six <unk> and once you go back to you, you're going back to everyone with your solution, <unk> go back to <unk> and says, "We're not <unk> Mr. <unk>
We're proud of <unk>
And he says that there is no person in <unk> <unk> who didn't want to leave your hand.
It's one of the very few times we see <unk> <unk> in history. It seems to me very emotional -- that scene is also mysterious, right?
It seems to treat <unk> as a problem of geometry, without excitement.
You know, in a minute <unk> it's the opposite side of <unk>
The next minute are the same side.
Suddenly, you can <unk> that idea of being the <unk>
It could still be so simple?
What if the <unk> are really a matter of geometry, just a matter of where we allow us to be in relation to the other?
Well, maybe we don't have to take care of the excellence of the other.
We can put it with it.
But I like the <unk> plans.
So as we hope that happens, let's remember that we have fiction for <unk>
Just fiction <unk> the jealousy.
fiction used to be invited to the table.
And look at what the sweet thing is, the terrifying terrifying to Tom Tom <unk> the crazy <unk> the very very very simple Revolution.
We're in excellent company.
Thank you.
We used to solve big problems.
The 21 of July of July 1969, Buzz Aldrin jumped out of the <unk> <unk> of Apollo 11, and he landed on the Ross Sea <unk>
Armstrong and Aldrin were themselves, but their presence at the surface surface of the world was the culmination of a collective process.
The Apollo program was the largest price of peace in American history.
To get to the moon, NASA was spent by 180 billion dollars a day, or four percent of the federal budget today.
The Apollo gave a few 400,000 people and asked the collaboration of 20,000 companies, universities and government agencies.
They died people, including the crew of Apollo 1.
But before the Apollo <unk> program went to the moon.
<unk> walked on the surface, of which millennia, after the death of Armstrong last year is now the most <unk>
So why do we <unk>
They didn't have a lot of <unk> <unk> pounds of old rocks, and something that 24 <unk> later, a new sense of <unk> and the fragility of our common home.
Why <unk> The cynical answer is because President Kennedy wanted to show the <unk> that this nation had better rockets.
But the words of Kennedy at the University of Rice in <unk> give us a better idea.
John F. <unk> Some ask why <unk>
Why turn it into our goal?
And they could also ask, why will climb the most <unk> mountain <unk>
So 35 years ago, why will fly over the <unk>
Why plays Rice against <unk>
We chose to go to the moon.
We chose to go to the moon.
We chose to go to the moon in this decade, and do other things, not because they're simple, but because they're difficult.
Jason <unk> For the <unk> the Apollo wasn't just a victory of the West on the Cold War.
At the time, the stronger emotion was <unk> before the powers of technology.
They were because it was a great thing to do it.
The landing on the moon came in in a context of a long list of technological thinker.
The first half of the 20th century produced the assembly line, and the airplane, the penicillin and the vaccine for tuberculosis.
In the middle of the century, the <unk> and just eliminated the smallpox.
Technology seemed to own what Alvin <unk> in 1970 called <unk> <unk>
For most of the history of humanity, we couldn't go faster than a horse, or a ship to candle -- but in 1969, the crew of Apollo 10 flew 40,000 miles /
Since 1970, no human will be back to the moon.
No one has ever traveled faster than the <unk> <unk> and the optimism joyful about the power of technology has been <unk> to see that the problems we imagine that technology would solve how to go to Mars, create a clean energy, cure cancer, or feeding the world population seem to have a result of <unk>
I remember <unk> <unk>
I was five years old, and my mother told me that I didn't get to the <unk> tube of the rocket <unk>
I knew that this would be the last <unk> mission but I was completely sure that I could see colonies on Mars.
So that actually happened to our ability to solve problems with <unk> has become a common place.
We heard it all the time.
We've heard it for the last two days here, at TED.
It seems like the technologists would have <unk> and we had enriched them with IP toys, things like <unk> applications and social networks, or algorithms that speed up the selling sale <unk>
There's nothing wrong about most of these things.
They've expanded and enriched our lives.
But we don't have the great problems of humanity.
What happened?
There's a <unk> explanation in Silicon Valley, that you have been created less ambitious companies that have been <unk> out of the years when you get away with, Microsoft, Apple and <unk>
Silicon Valley says that markets are the guilty, in particular, the incentives that venture capitalists offer entrepreneurs.
Silicon Valley says that the investment investment investment is going to be created by creation of ideas <unk> by funding by <unk> or even false problems.
But I don't think this explanation is good enough.
It's mostly going wrong with <unk> Valley.
Even when the venture capitalists were at their high point without worrying about the risk, they preferred small investment investment, which they could go out in 10 years.
<unk> have always had trouble investing with a benefit in technologies like energy, which need a huge capital and that development is in the long term.
No, the reasons why we can't solve the big problems are more complicated, and deep and profound things.
Sometimes we choose not to solve big problems.
Could we go to Mars if we <unk>
NASA has even designed a plan.
But going on Mars it would make a policy decision that being popular, and that will never happen.
We will not go to Mars because everybody thinks there are things more important than doing on Earth.
Sometimes we can't solve the big problems because political systems fail.
Today, less than two percent of the world's energy consumption comes from sources of renewable energy like solar and wind and <unk> less than two percent, and the reason is completely cheap.
coal and natural gas are cheaper than solar and wind, and oil is cheaper than the <unk>
We want alternative energy sources that can compete in price.
Now, technologists, the entrepreneurs and economists agree on what policies and international treaties -- the development of an <unk> energy -- <unk> a significant increase in the research and energy development and some kind of carbon price control.
But there is no hope in the political climate that we're going to see an energy policy policy or international treaties that reflect that consensus.
Sometimes the big problems that seem to be discovered is not to be.
We know for the time that markets are the result of failure in the <unk>
But 30 years of research has taught us that markets are political crisis that affect the distribution of food.
Technology can improve things like crops or systems for storage and <unk> but there will be famines while there was bad governments.
Finally, large problems are going to make a solution because we don't understand the real problem.
The president refused to tell the war to the cancer in 1971, but soon we discovered that there are many kinds of cancer, some terribly resistant to the treatment, and only over the last 10 years, they seem to have found effective and effective treatments and viable.
The hard problems are hard.
It's not true that we couldn't solve problems with technology.
We can and <unk> but these four elements have to be <unk>
The <unk> mission that has become something like a metaphor for the ability of technology to solve big problems, it does with those <unk>
But it's a <unk> model in the future.
We're not in <unk>
There is no <unk> competition like in the Cold War, there's no politician like John Kennedy that <unk> the hard and dangerous, and there's no popular mythology of science fiction as we explore the solar system.
In general, it turned out to be simple.
I was just three days.
And I really didn't even have a problem.
We're alone in our present, and the solutions of the future are going to be harder to get.
God knows that we don't have the challenges.
Thank you very much.
Well, I'm going to talk about trust, and I'm going to start with <unk> ideas that have about trust.
They are so common that they've become <unk> of our society.
I think it's three.
The first one is a <unk> there's been a big decline in trust, and it's a very general belief, for it.
The second one is that we should have more trust.
And the third one is a <unk> we should actually recover trust.
I think the goal is the goal and the task has been wrong.
What I'm going to try and tell you today is a different story about a <unk> one goal and a task, which I think gives you a bigger idea about the subject.
First of all, what people think that trust has <unk>
And if I think about the basis of my own <unk> I don't know the answer.
I bow to think that it may have gone down in some activities or institutions and that could have increased others.
I don't have it clear.
But I can turn to the opinion polls and the opinion polls are supposedly the source of the belief that trust has decreased.
When you look at the opinion polls over time, there are no evidence of it.
I mean, the people who were <unk> 20 years ago, mostly journalists and politicians, still <unk> the same <unk>
And the people who were very reliable about 20 years ago, they are still quite <unk> their nurses.
The rest of us are in the middle, and by the way, the average citizen of the street is almost exactly half the way.
But this is evidence enough?
What the opinion polls are, of course, opinions.
What else can you do it?
What you look at is the attitudes of the attitudes that people are, when you get certain questions.
<unk> in <unk> <unk> in the <unk>
Now, if somebody asked you, <unk> in the <unk>
<unk> in <unk>
<unk> in the <unk> teachers.
Probably <unk> by asking, "What is it what?"
And that would be a very <unk> answer.
And you could say, when you've answered your question, "Well, I trust some some, but in other not."
What's very rational.
Ultimately, in real life, we tend to deposit trust <unk>
We don't assume that the level of trust we're going to feel for a kind of <unk> official or type of person, is going to be uniform in all cases.
I could, for example, say I trust a certain elementary teacher that I know to give the class, but no way to drive the school <unk>
After all, I could know that it wasn't a good <unk>
I could trust my <unk> friend to keep a conversation, but not, maybe to hold a secret.
Simple.
And if we have gotten those evidence in our everyday lives in the way that trust is <unk> why we stop the knowledge when we think about trust in a way more <unk>
I think these surveys are very bad tools to measure the real level of real trust because they try to make a good judgment of inherent judgment in something or somebody.
Second, what about the goal?
The goal is to have more trust.
Frankly, I think it's just stupid.
It's not that one goal that I <unk>
I want to have more confidence in what it is for trust, but not what it isn't.
Ultimately, I'm a <unk> of not trusting what is not reliable.
And I think that those people who were saving their savings with very <unk> called Mr. <unk> which then disappeared with them, I think of them, and I think, well, they were too <unk>
Having more trust is not a smart goal in this life.
<unk> deposited or <unk> with intelligence, that's the right target.
Once you tell you that he says, yeah, OK, that means that what matters first is not trust, but trustworthiness.
What it's about to do is to do a judgment on how reliable people are in certain ways.
And I think that to be able to do a trial, we're forced to focus on three things.
They're <unk> They're <unk> They're <unk>
And if we found that one person is <unk> in the raw materials and it's responsible for and honest, then we have a very good reason to trust it, because it's going to be worthy of trust.
But if on the contrary, it's not yet, we couldn't trust them.
I have friends who are <unk> and honest, but not <unk> in them to take a letter to the mail because they're <unk>
I have friends who are very sure that they can do certain things, but I see that they would get their own <unk>
And I'm very happy to say that I think I don't have a lot of friends that are <unk> and responsible but extremely <unk>
If it's like this, I still haven't been <unk>
But that's what we're looking at -- we have before confidence.
So trust is the answer.
<unk> is what we need to be <unk>
And of course, it's hard.
In the last decades, we've tried to build accountability systems for all kinds of institutions, professionals, officials and so forth, that make us easier for the task to judge their trustworthiness.
Many of those systems have had the opposite effect.
They don't work like <unk>
I remember once I was talking to a <unk> and he said, "Well, you can see the problem is it takes more time to do the Web <unk> that will be <unk>
And we found the same problem in all of our public life, and <unk> that the accountability system that is meant to ensure that <unk> and <unk> evidence is actually doing the opposite.
What they do is <unk> the work of the people who have to make hard tasks like the <unk> <unk> that <unk> the <unk> as we say.
You've got all of you to know similar examples.
It was going to take away all that, for the target.
I think the goal should be more <unk> and that things would be different if they were trying to be worthy of trust and <unk> the people who are reliable and if we try to determine whether other people or politicians are worthy of trust.
It's not easy. It's the trial, the simple actions -- the <unk> which doesn't do properly.
Third, the task.
And we would get to the task to rebuild the trust, puts things upside down.
It suggests that you and I should rebuild trust.
Well, we can do it with ourselves.
We can rebuild a bit of trustworthiness.
We can do it if they're two people, together, trying to improve trust.
But the trust, ultimately, this is kind of a signature because we give up other people.
You can't reconstruct what other people have given you.
You have to give them enough for you to trust you.
You have to be worthy of confidence.
And that, of course, is because you can't afford to eat all of the people, all the time.
But you also have to be able to make sure that you're worthy of confidence.
How do we do it?
That makes every day, everywhere, it makes it a common people, <unk> institutions, very effectively.
I'll give you a simple example.
The store where I buy my <unk> says that I can <unk> it without giving us explanations out.
I take it and make me the money, or they turn it out of the color I want.
That's great. I trust them because they themselves became vulnerable to me.
I think there's a great lesson in that.
If you get vulnerable to the other hand, that's a very good proof that you're worthy of trust and you have confidence in what you're saying.
So, in the end, I think that what we are pointing is not a very hard thing to do.
What people trust are in relationships, and in that frame, they can determine when and how the other person is worthy of trust.
Thank you.
Since the early computers we have been <unk> to reduce the separation between us and digital information, the separation between our material world and the world of the screen that the imagination can be <unk>
This separation has been <unk> more and more and more, at a point that today is less than one millimeter, the product of the glass of <unk> and the power of computing has become accessible to everyone.
But I ask myself, and if I had no <unk>
So I started imagining how I <unk>
So first I created this tool that goes into the digital space, so that when the strong <unk> against the screen it transfers its physical body at the bottom.
Designers can <unk> their ideas directly in 3D, and surgeons can practice with virtual organs underneath the screen.
So with this tool, the barriers.
But the two hands remain still out of the screen.
How do you get to the inside and interact with digital information using the whole skill of the hands?
In the <unk> Sciences of Microsoft, along with my mentor <unk> <unk> <unk> the computer and transformed a small space on the keyboard in a digital <unk>
We have a transparent bombsight with camera cameras to detect your fingers and your face, you can now lift the hands of the keyboard, get to the inside of 3D space, and grab pixels directly with your hands.
As the windows and the files have a location in real space, it is so easy to grab a book from a <unk>
You can flip through the book and you can highlight lines or words with the virtual touch sensor that is down on the bottom of every floating screen.
architects can stretch or rotate their models directly with their hands.
So in these examples, we were <unk> in the digital world.
And if we reverse the papers and we make digital information come to us?
We have a lot of us we would have bought and returned things by the Internet.
Now that doesn't have to worry about that.
What I have here is a virtual <unk> on the Internet.
This is the vision you get from a device on your head or <unk> when the system understands the geometry of your body.
If we take this idea further, I thought, instead of just seeing pixels in space, how can we make physical physics so that we can <unk> and <unk>
How would a future like this?
At the Media Lab at the MIT Media Lab in the MIT Media Lab, and my collaborator <unk> Desert.
This <unk> magnet is behaving as a pixel pixel in space, which means that both the computer as users can move the object anywhere inside this little three-dimensional space.
<unk> what we did was we <unk> gravity and controlling the movement by a combination of <unk> and the <unk> <unk> and <unk>
And when we program the object, we release it from the constraints of time and space, which means that human movements can <unk> and will be able to reproduce and they stay in the physical world.
You can teach it physically and a distance and the famous shot of Michael Jordan, can play as a physical reality, the times that we want.
The students can use it as a tool to understand complicated concepts like the motion of planets, the physics, and, unlike the monitors or textbooks -- this is a real experience and palpable experience that you can touch and feel.
But what's more fascinating to change the physical part of the computer is to imagine how to program the world is going to change our everyday physical activities.
As you see, digital information is not just going to show us something but begin to act directly about us as part of the physical world around us without that we have to <unk> our world.
So we started talking today about a barrier, but if you take that barrier, the only limit that's left is our imagination.
Thank you.
I was <unk> to become a <unk> for two years in <unk> China, in the years.
When I was in the first grade, the government wanted to go to a school for athletes with all expenses up.
But my tiger mother said, "No."
My parents wanted me to become engineering, like them.
After we survive the American Revolution, they create firmly that there was only one moving path to <unk> a safe job and <unk>
No matter if I work or not.
But my dream was to be a Chinese opera singer surgery.
This was me, in my imaginary piano.
An opera singer has to start <unk> from very young to learn the <unk> so I tried everything I could to go to the opera school.
I just wrote to the director of school and the host of a radio show.
But there's no adult <unk> the idea.
No adult took me seriously.
Only my friends, I was <unk> but they were kids, without authority, like me.
So at age 15, I knew that it was too much more to train.
My dream is never <unk>
<unk> that during the rest of my life a second class of second class was the only thing to aspire to.
And this was so unfair.
So I decided to look for another <unk>
No one to me around me wanted to <unk> OK.
I would take the books.
<unk> <unk> <unk> -- I mean, I was <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> I came to the United States in 1995, and what were the first books I got here?
The ones that were <unk> in China, of course.
"The Good <unk> is about Chinese <unk>
And it's not <unk> <unk>
The Bible is interesting, but strange one.
That's a theme for another day.
But the fifth commandment for me was a <unk> <unk> to your father and your mother."
<unk> I told me, "It's so different, and so much better than <unk>
So it became my tool to get out of this <unk> <unk> <unk> and to <unk> the relationship with my parents.
The encounter with a new culture also brought place to my <unk> habit of read.
So we had a lot of perspectives.
For example, at the beginning this map seemed to me out of place, because this is what students in China learn.
I'd never occurred to me that China didn't have to be in the center of the world.
A map involves the perspective of people.
The comparative reading is not something new.
It's a common practice in the academic world.
There are all the research fields as comparative religion and literature.
<unk> and <unk> gives academics a deeper understanding of a subject.
And I thought if the comparative reading worked for research, why not do it in life as well.
So I started reading books from two.
They can be <unk> <unk> from Walter <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> who were involved in a same <unk> or friends with <unk> experiences.
For <unk> <unk> are economic and spiritual and spiritual <unk>
For Buddha, they're all <unk> lust, fear and <unk> <unk>
If you know another language, it's fun to read your favorite books in two languages.
<unk> path of <unk> <unk> Thomas <unk> <unk> path of <unk> Alan <unk> Instead of missing in the translation, I found that you can win a lot of it.
For example, it's through the translation that I realized Chinese <unk> literally means <unk> <unk> <unk>
And <unk> in Chinese, literally means <unk> <unk>
The books opened up a magic door to connect with people in the past and the present.
I know I'm not going to feel like I used to feel or powerless people.
Having a <unk> dream is not nothing compared to what many others have <unk>
I've come to believe that the realization is not the only purpose of a dream.
Their most important purpose is to connect with the place that the dreams, where the passion comes from, where happiness comes from.
A <unk> dream can do that for you.
And it's because of the books, I'm here, happy, living again with purpose and clarity, most of the time.
So the books are always <unk>
Thank you.
Thank you.  Thank you.
When I was in my <unk> I saw my first customer <unk>
I was a Ph.D. student in clinical clinic at Berkeley.
She was a <unk> woman named <unk>
Alex walked into the first session using jeans and a <unk> <unk> he threw up my office couch, took off the shoes and told me I wanted to talk about his problems with men.
When I heard this, I felt so <unk>
My roommate had a <unk> like the first client.
And I had a <unk> I wanted to talk about men.
I thought I could handle it.
But I didn't.
With the stories of <unk> that Alex brought me to <unk> it made me easy to move your head while you were putting the solution.
<unk> are the new <unk> saying Alex, and so I looked at it, she was right.
You start working on, and then you start working afterwards, you have children later, until death happens next.
For <unk> as Alex and I had time to get it.
But shortly later, my <unk> pushed me to Alex who would talk about his life <unk>
I was <unk>
I said, "Yes, he's coming out with guys under his category, he <unk> with a <unk> head, but it's not like she was to marry him."
And then my <unk> said, "No, no, but maybe it <unk> on the next one.
Also, the best time to work on marriage marriage is before they were <unk>
This is what psychologists call a <unk> moment.
It was when I realized that the <unk> are not the new <unk>
Yes, people feel their head after what they <unk> but this didn't make the <unk> from Alex were a pause in their development.
This made the <unk> of Alex were the perfect moment, and we were <unk>
And so I realized, that this kind of benign telecommunications was a real problem and had real consequences -- not only for Alex and his loving life, but for the careers, the families and the future <unk>
There are 50 million <unk> in the United States, today.
This means 15 percent of the population, or 100 percent if they think no one goes to age without spending before the <unk>
Raise your hand if you're in your <unk>
I want to see the <unk> here.
Oh, Yes! They're amazing.
If they work with <unk> they love a <unk> you take a <unk> a <unk> I want to see. It's okay.
This is not just my opinion. These are the facts.
We know that 80 percent of the key moments in life will spend the 35 years.
This means eight of every 10 decisions and experiences and <unk> moments that shape their life will have happened to have 30 and <unk>
<unk> of more 40, I don't get to panic.
This audience is going to be okay, I think.
We know that the first 10 years of a race have an exponential impact on the amount of money that we have.
We know more than half of Americans are married, they live or they're coming out with their future partner at the age of 30 years.
We know that the brain ends up its second and last stage of growth in its <unk> and <unk> to <unk> which means that if there's something you want to change themselves, now it's time to change it.
We know that personality changes more times during their <unk> than at any other time of life, and we know that the female fertility comes to its top to the 28, and things become complicated to <unk>
<unk> are the time to get them over their body and their options.
When we think about development development, we all know that the first five years are critical to language and attachment to the brain.
It's a moment in which your everyday life and common life has an <unk> impact on the person who is <unk>
But what we don't hear is that there's something called adult development and our <unk> are a critical moment in adult development.
But this is not what the <unk> are listening.
The newspapers talk about changes in the line of <unk>
The researchers call the <unk> a <unk> adolescence
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> as <unk> and <unk>
It's true.
As a culture, we've considered a <unk> which is actually the decade that defines the <unk>
Leonard <unk> said that to make great things, you need a plan and not enough time.
It's not it?
What do you think happens when you give a <unk> in your head and say, "You have another 10 years to start your <unk>
There's nothing going on.
They stole that person's sense of urgency and ambition and it doesn't happen absolutely nothing.
And then every day, <unk> intelligent, kind of cool like you or your children and daughters get to my office and say something like this: "I know my boyfriend is not good for me, but this relationship is not just killing time."
Or they say, "All say that as I start a career before 30, all being okay."
But then it starts going to sound something like this: "My <unk> are <unk> and I still have nothing to show you.
I was better programming the day I graduated from <unk>
And then it starts going to sound something like this: "My quotes during the <unk> were like the game of chairs.
They were all running and <unk> but then at some point around 30, the music went down, and they all started sitting there.
I didn't want to be the only thing to be stop, so I sometimes think I married my husband because he was the nearest chair when he had <unk>
Where are the <unk> here?
Don't do that.
Well, that sounds a little bit extreme -- but you don't know -- the risks are very high.
When you leave a lot of things for the <unk> there's a huge pressure to the 30 and so many of them starting a career, to pick up a mate, and have two or three children in a much more short period of time.
Many of these things are not <unk> and there are research that they start to show, which is much more difficult and kind of kind of kind of doing the <unk>
The middle-aged crisis, <unk> is not about buying red sports cars.
It's about realizing you can't have the career you want now.
You realize you can't have the child you want now, or you can't give a brother to your son.
Many <unk> and <unk> look at themselves, and to me, sitting in the room, and they talk about their <unk> "What was I thinking?"
I want to change what the <unk> are doing and thinking.
Here's a story about how it might be.
It's a story about a woman called <unk>
At the age of 25, Emma came to my office because he was, in his own words, having an identity.
He said he would like to work in art or the entertainment, but we still couldn't decide, so I spent the last few years working like <unk>
As it was cheaper, she lived with a boyfriend who showed more <unk> than ambition.
And even though they live a lot of <unk> very difficult, his previous life had been even more difficult.
It was often often in our <unk> but then he was getting up she saying, "You don't choose your family, but you can choose your friends."
Well, one day Emma got his head on his legs and he cried for almost the entire hour.
I had just buy a new book for <unk> and I had spent the whole morning and I had a lot of good ones, but then he was looking at the empty space that follows after the words "In <unk> please call <unk>
I was about to <unk> when he saw me and said, "Who is going to be for me if I have a <unk> accident.
Who is going to take care of me <unk>
At that time, I had a lot of work to resist and not say, <unk>
What Emma needed was not a <unk> that really was <unk>
Emma needed a better life, and I knew that this was his chance.
I had learned a lot since I worked with Alex as to just sit while the decade <unk> from Emma going on.
So, for the next few weeks and months, I told Emma three things that all <unk> man or woman, deserves to know.
First of all, I told Emma who are <unk> from that identity crisis, and <unk> identity.
For identity, I mean to do something that add value to your person.
Doing something that is an investment in what they want to be after.
I didn't know the future of <unk> and no one knows the future of work, but I know this: capital capital generates capital capital.
So now it's time for that work on the other side of the country, from that business that you want to try to try it out.
I'm not going to do that <unk> exploration -- I am <unk> the exploration that shouldn't tell you, which, by the way, is not exploration,
It's <unk>
I told Emma who would explore jobs and to make it count.
Second, I told Emma that urban tribes are <unk>
The best friends are great to take you at the airport, but the <unk> they come together with friends with the similar minds they are limited as they know who you know about how they think, how they speak, and where they work.
That new piece of capital, that new person who comes out of it almost always comes from the nearest circle.
The new things come from what they call weak links from friends of friends.
Yes, half the <unk> have a bad job or they don't have work.
But the other half no not, and the weak links are the way we get to this group.
Half of the jobs that we have never been <unk> then meet the boss of your neighbor is the way you get a work not published.
It's not cheating. It's the science of how information happens.
For the last but not least, Emma believed that you don't choose his family, but I know his friends.
This was really true when I was growing up, but as a <unk> happiness will soon take his family when she has a partner and it is his own family.
I told Emma that the time to choose his family had come.
Maybe you think 30 is better enough to sit the 20 or even 25 and even 25 and I agree with you.
But to choose the person that you live right now, or you get to you, now when everyone on Facebook are starting to walk towards the <unk> it's not progress.
The best time to work in your marriage is before you have it, and that means being as <unk> in love as you're in the work.
<unk> your family has to be a conscious choice of who and what they want instead of just to make it work or kill time with whoever you are at you.
So what happened to <unk>
Well, we looked at that <unk> and she found the fellow <unk> of a cousin who worked in a art museum in another state.
This weak bond helped him get a job there.
That offer of work gave him a reason to leave the boyfriend who I alive.
Five years later, it's <unk> special events in museums.
This married a man who chose <unk>
<unk> his new career, he loves his new family, and I send a letter to me to say, "Now the spaces of contacts are not <unk> enough.
The story of Emma may sound easy, but that's what I love to work with <unk>
It's very easy to help them.
The <unk> are like planes coming out of the Los Angeles airport coming somewhere in the West.
Just before the <unk> a light fits in its trajectory makes the difference between landing in Alaska or in <unk>
Similarly, at 21 or 25 and even <unk> a good conversation, a good deal -- a good TED Talk can have huge effects in the next few years or even in the next generation.
Here's my idea worth spreading all the <unk>
It's as simple as what I learned to say to <unk>
It's what I have now the privilege of saying to <unk> like Emma every day." The <unk> are not the new <unk> <unk> their <unk> get your identity capital, you get their weak ties to pick your family.
Don't stop defining what they didn't know or what they didn't know.
They're deciding their life today.
Thank you.
When I was 27 years old, I left a very hard job in management management for a job that was even more <unk> <unk>
I went to teach them mathematics in seventh grade students in the public schools in New York.
And as any teacher, I took tests and tests.
I give them tasks.
When the work came, I was grades.
What struck me the attention was that <unk> was not the only difference between my best and my worst students.
Some of the ones who had a better performance did not have scores of <unk> <unk>
Some of my smartest children were not going so well.
And that got me thinking.
The kind of things you need to learn in mathematics in seventh grade, sure, are <unk> <unk> <unk> the area of a <unk>
But these concepts are not impossible and I was very convinced that every one of my students could learn the lesson if they worked hard and for enough time.
After several years, I came to the conclusion that what we need in education is a better understanding of students and learning from a <unk> perspective from a psychological perspective.
In education, the only thing we know how to measure how to measure a better way.
It's the <unk> but what if you have success in school and life depends on much more than the ability to learn from rapid and easy?
So I left the classrooms and I went to college to become a <unk>
I started studying children and adults in all sorts of <unk> <unk> and in every study my question was, who is success here and why?
My research team and I went to the <unk> West <unk>
And we're trying to predict what <unk> <unk> in military training.
We went to the National National <unk> and we tried to predict what children were going on as far as possible in the competition.
We studied everyday professors -- working in neighborhoods that are really difficult -- <unk> what teachers are still teaching at the end of the year and <unk> and who will be the more effective in improving the results of their <unk>
We associate with private companies, asking yourself, what about <unk> are going to keep their <unk>
It's going to make more money?
In all those very different contexts, he came up with a feature as a important <unk> of success.
And it wasn't social intelligence.
It wasn't the good look, the physical health, and it was not <unk>
It was <unk>
<unk> is passion and resilience to achieve very long term.
<unk> is to have a resistance.
<unk> is clinging to its future, day after day, not only for the week, not only for the month, but for years and work really hard to make that future a reality.
<unk> is to live life as if it was a <unk> not a race at all.
A few years ago, I started studying the determination in the public public schools.
I asked thousands of high school students to do my questionnaires from determination and then waited for more than a year to see who <unk>
It turns out that children with more determination had significantly greater chance of <unk> even when they were <unk> in every feature that I could measure, things like family income results -- even security that they felt children when they were in school.
So it's not just in West Point or in the National <unk> <unk> where <unk> is also in school, especially for children at risk of <unk>
For me, the most powerful thing about determination is how little we know, how little science knows about development.
Every day, parents and teachers ask me, "How development is the determination in children?
What should I do to teach kids a solid ethic of work?
How do I keep them motivated for the long <unk>
The most honest answer is, I don't know.  What I know is that talent doesn't give them <unk>
Our data shows very clearly that there are many talented individuals who just don't go ahead with their <unk>
In fact, in our data, the absolute determination isn't related or even related to the measurements of talent.
So far, the best idea I've heard about developing the determination in children is something called <unk>
This is an idea that was developed at Stanford University by Carol <unk> and it's the belief that the ability to learn is not fixed that it can change the effort.
Dr. <unk> has shown that when kids read and learn about the brain and how it changes and grow in response to the challenge, they are much more likely to <unk> when they <unk> because they don't believe that that failure is a permanent condition.
So the mentality of growth is a great idea to develop <unk>
But we need more.
And that's where my speech, because that's where we are.
That's the work we have on the front.
We need to take our best ideas, our stronger intuitions and we need to <unk>
We need to measure whether they have been successful and we have to be willing to fail, to <unk> to start all again with the lessons that we have.
In other words, we need to be certain about making our children more <unk>
Thank you.
I put in Taiwan as a daughter of a <unk> one of my most <unk> memories is my mother <unk> the beauty and the shape of the Chinese characters.
Since that time, I was inspired by this incredible language.
But for a overseas, it seems to be as <unk> as the Great Wall China.
In the last few years, I have been wondering if I can bring down this <unk> so that I want to understand and appreciate the beauty of this sophisticated language can do it.
I started thinking about how a new approach to learn Chinese to learn Chinese to be useful.
Since I was five years old, I started learning how to draw every one of the strokes of every character in the right sequence.
I learned new characters every day for the next 15 years.
Since we only have five minutes, it's better than we do it in a faster and simple way.
A Chinese academic <unk> 20,000 characters.
You just need a thousand to understand basic literacy to it.
The first 200 will allow you to understand 40 percent of the basic literature -- enough to read traffic signals, <unk> <unk> to understand the basic idea of the Web or the newspapers.
Today I started with eight to show you how the method.
Are you ready?
You open your mouth as much as you might be able to be <unk>
They get a mouth.
This is a person who's going to give a ride.
<unk>
If the way of fire is a person with arms in both sides, as if I were shouting at <unk> <unk> I'm <unk> -- this is actually <unk> in the form of called, but I like to believe it's the other way.
This is a tree.
tree tree tree.
This is a mountain.
The sun.
The moon.
The symbol of the door looks like a pair of doors in the old West.
I call <unk> to these eight characters.
They're building blocks so they believe many more characters.
One person.
If you walk back, that's <unk>
As the old said, two are a company, two are a crowd.
If a person stretch their arms, this person is saying <unk> this big.
The person inside the mouth, the person is <unk>
It's just a DNA, as <unk> inside the whale.
A tree is a tree. Two trees together, we have a forest.
Three trees together, we also have the forest.
Put a table under the tree, we have the <unk>
Put a mouth on the tree, that's a <unk> --  I can remember, because a single tree is pretty an idiot.
Do you remember the <unk>
Two like together, it's very hot.
Three tasks together, that's a lot of flames.
Put the fire under the two trees, that's <unk>
For us, the sun is the source of prosperity.
Two <unk> together, <unk>
Three together, those are <unk>
Put the sun and the moon bright together, that's the <unk>
It also means tomorrow, after one day and night.
The sun comes over the horizon.
A door. Put a table inside the door, it's the <unk> of the door.
Put a mouth inside the door, ask questions.
<unk> played someone at home?
This person is coming out hidden from a door, <unk> <unk>
On the left, we have a woman.
Two women together, they're <unk>
Three women together, get care of <unk>
So we've already spent about 30 characters.
By using this method, the first eight radical <unk> will allow you to build 32.
The next group of eight characters will build some other 32.
So with every little effort, you will be able to learn a couple of hundreds of them, which is the same thing that you learn a Chinese eight years.
So after knowing the characters, we started to create sentences.
For example, the mountain and fire together, we have a mountain of fire. It's a <unk>
We know Japan is the land of the sun <unk>
This is a sun placed in the beginning, because Japan is in China.
So one sun along the beginning, we created Japan.
One person behind Japan, what do we have?
A Japanese person.
The character on the left is two mountains stacked up one on the other.
In the ancient China, that meant in <unk> because the Chinese <unk> <unk> their political enemies beyond the mountains.
Today, the exile has become a date.
A mouth that tells you where to go out is an output.
This is a slide to remind me that I have to stop talking and come down the stage. Thank you.
What I prefer to be my dad is the movies I come to see.
I love to share my favorite films with my <unk> when my daughter was four years old, and we saw the magician of Oz together.
The film is taken its imagination for months.
His favorite character was <unk> of course.
He gave him a good excuse to use a bright dress and bring a bright dress and take a magic wand there.
But when you see that film so many times, you get to understand that it's extraordinary.
We now live and we raised our children in a kind of industrial <unk> an industrial fantasy programs.
However, the TED magician was an event itself.
It didn't start that trend.
The trend really took rise to 40 years later with, interestingly, another movie whose <unk> a metal boy and a <unk> <unk> <unk> a girl wearing a <unk>
You know what I'm talking about?
There's a big difference between these two films, there's a couple of big differences between the magician of Oz and all the movies we see today.
One is that there's very little violence in the <unk>
The monkeys are pretty aggressive, like <unk>
But I think if the magician of Oz is done today, the magician would say, <unk> you're the salvation of Oz as a prophecy.
It was magical shoes to defeat <unk> <unk> by the computer of evil <unk>
But that's not what happens.
The other one in the magician of Oz is that the most <unk> characters and even <unk> are women.
I began to notice this when I did "Star Star daughter, a few years later, and the situation was different.
At that time, I also had a son of it.
It's only three years.
He wasn't invited to projection because it was still very small for that.
But it was the second son, and the level of surveillance had <unk>  So he was in the room and I was wrapped in the room and became impressed as a mom with her <unk> behind, and I don't think he understood what was happening, but <unk> <unk> everything.
I wonder what <unk>
Would you be themes of value, resilience and <unk>
It would be the feeling that Luke a military to <unk> the government?
<unk> this with the magician of Oz <unk>
How do you win Dorothy his film?
By making good <unk> with everybody and being a <unk>
It's the kind of world that I want my kids to grow up to grow up, OK? And not a world of men who are <unk> which is where we are.
Why is there so much savings capital in the movies for our children, and so little on the path of brick <unk>
There's a lot of literature about the impact of male violence in the girls, and they should be <unk> It's very good.
I haven't read so much about how kids react to this encouragement.
I know because of the experience that the princess <unk> doesn't give me the proper framework that I would have served to navigate the world of the adults who is <unk>  I think at the moment of the first kiss I really expected that the credit is going to come up because it's the end of the film, right?
My quest is done, I have <unk>
Why are you still there?
I don't know what I should do.
The movies are focused on defeat the <unk> and get your reward, and you don't leave time for other relationships or other <unk>
It's almost like a child, you have to be a silly animal, and if you're a girl, you have to use a <unk>
There are lots of exceptions, and to defend them from Disney to any of you.
But they send a message to children, even though they, are not really their target public.
They do a fantastic job by teaching girls how to defend against the <unk> but they don't necessarily show kids how to defend from the <unk>
There's no model for them.
We also have some great women who write new stories for our children, as real and lovely as <unk> and <unk> but they don't stop being a movies of war.
Of course, the most successful theme of all times continues to rise in classic number one one of them about the adventures of a child or a man, or two men who are friends, or a man and the son, or two men who have <unk> a child.
Until as many of you are thinking, this year finally came out.
I recommend all of you. It's available in stores.
Remember what the critical criticism said when he came out.
I can't believe that Pixar is actually a movie of a <unk>
It's very good. Don't let it be <unk>
Well, almost none of these movies is <unk>
I don't know if you've heard about this.
It's still not completely <unk> but maybe we're going to start a movement.
<unk> <unk> is a comic book <unk> and in the <unk> '80s, I recorded a conversation that had had with a friend of the movies that you saw.
And it's very simple. There are only three questions that should be <unk> in the film, there are more than a female character than it is to be.
So, you have to get the <unk>
These women talk to each other at some point in the film?
Their conversations are about something more than you like to like it?  All right? Thank you.  Thank you very much.
Two women who exist and talk about things with each other.
<unk> I've seen, and yet I really rarely see it in the film we know and love.
In fact, this week I went to see a very good quality film, <unk>
Right? <unk> of <unk> success -- an idea of consensus of what a Hollywood Hollywood film.
<unk> isn't the proof of <unk>
And I don't think <unk> because a lot of the film, I don't know if you've seen a lot of the movie happens in a embassy where men and women are hiding during the crisis of the <unk>
We have a lot of scenes of men who have profound and painful and painful and painful and the great moment for one of the actors to take a look at the door and say, <unk> to bed, <unk>
This is Hollywood.
So I would go through the numbers.
In 2011, from the 100 most popular films how many of them believe they have actors else.
<unk> Not bad.
It's not the same percentage that the number of women we've chosen for Congress, then it's okay.
But there's a larger number that this is going to take away this room.
Last year, The New York Times published a study that the government had done.
This is what he said, this is what it said, <unk>
In the United States, one in five women are in the United States, one in the United States, it has been sexually <unk>
I don't think it is the mass entertainment.
I don't think that movies for children have something to do with that.
I also don't think that music videos or <unk> are closely <unk> but something goes wrong, and when I hear that statistics, one of the things I think is that there's a lot of sexual <unk>
Who are those <unk> What are those <unk>
What do they not get <unk>
They're <unk> the story that says the role of a male hero is to defeat the <unk> with violence and then charge the reward, which is a woman who has no friends and not <unk>
We're telling that story?
You know, as a father with the privilege of raising a daughter like those of you who are doing the same thing, we find this world and this very startling statistic and we want to <unk>
We have tools to be like <unk> <unk> and we hope that that <unk> but I have to ask, <unk> <unk> is going to <unk> if, at the same time, active or <unk> we are educating our children so that they have their power <unk>
I mean, I think the Netflix list is a way to do something really important, and here I mean mostly the parents.
I think we have to show our children a new definition of <unk>
The definition of <unk> is radically changing.
You have read about how the new economy is changing the role of the <unk> and the <unk>
Everything is changing.
When I asked my daughter, what was his favorite favorite character of Star Trek <unk>
<unk>
<unk> <unk> and <unk>
What are these <unk>
Maybe it's not just the brilliant dress there.
I think they're experts.
I think these are the two people in those movies that know more than anyone, and they love to share their knowledge with other people in order to get their potential.
They are leaders.
I like that kind of stories for my daughter, and I like that kind of stories for my son.
I want more stories like that.
I want less stories in which I tell my <unk> <unk> and struggle only and more stories where his job is to join a team, maybe a team led by women, to help other people improve and be better people, like <unk>
Thank you.
As a child, I was living in Maine and one of the things I liked was to look at baseball cookies, because my parents told me that I would be lucky.
But you know, it's hard to find these <unk>
They're covered in sand and it's hard to see them.
And yet, over time, I went to <unk>
I began to see shapes and patterns that helped me <unk>
This became a passion for finding things, in a love for the past and the <unk>
And finally when I started studying <unk> I realized to see with my own eyes wasn't enough.
Because, suddenly, in Egypt, my little beach in Maine had grown up to about 1.3 miles of length next to the <unk>
My sea biscuits had grown to the size of cities.
This is really what led me to use satellite images.
To try to make a map of the past, I knew I had to see another way.
I want to show you an example of how different we see by using the <unk>
This is a place sitting in the eastern <unk> in Egypt called <unk>
And place, in the naked eye, it seems to be brown but when we use infrared and we process it using fake color, suddenly the place looks like pink <unk>
What you're seeing is the real chemical changes of the landscape caused by building materials and the activities of the ancient movies.
I want to share with you how we used the satellite data to find an old city, ancient <unk> called <unk> for thousands of years.
<unk> was the old Egypt of the old Egypt for over 400 years in a period of time called the Roman Empire about 4,000 years ago.
The place is <unk> Egypt, and it's really important because in the Middle Empire there was this great renaissance of the old art -- architecture and religion.
<unk> have always known that <unk> was located somewhere near the pyramids of the two kings that the <unk> <unk> within the red circles here, but somewhere inside this huge <unk> <unk>
This area is massive, measures roughly <unk> by <unk> miles.
Back in the Before, he was going on right next to <unk> and as it changed over time, he moved to this one and covered all the city.
So how do you find a city <unk> in a <unk> landscape.
I'll try to find that randomly would be the equivalent of looking for a needle in a <unk> with the eyes <unk> and using baseball.
So, we use NASA data to make a map of the place, with very subtle changes.
We were able to see where the <unk>
But you can see more <unk> and it's even more interesting, this slightly elevated area that looks inside the circle here, which we think could be the location of <unk>
So we collaborated with Egyptians doing <unk> jobs -- you can see it here.
When I say <unk> it's like the shots of sample on ice, but instead of climate change, we look for human occupation for us.
Five meters down, below a thick <unk> layer, we found a dense layer of <unk> objects.
This means that in this possible location of <unk> five meters down, we have a <unk> <unk> of hundreds of years coming back from the Empire Middle Empire that we think it's <unk>
We also found <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> and <unk> which shows that there was a <unk> <unk>
This might seem not a lot, but when we think about the most common stones used in the jewelry of the Middle Empire these are the stones that are <unk>
So we have a very dense occupation of occupation that goes back from the Roman Empire in this place.
We also have evidence of an elite jewelry shop, which shows that what has been there was a very important city.
We still didn't find <unk> here, but we had a place in a near future to <unk>
And even more importantly, we have the resources to train young Egyptians in the use of satellite technology so that they can also make great discoveries.
I want to end with my favorite quote from the Roman Empire and it probably was written in <unk> about 4,000 years ago.
To share knowledge is the biggest of all the <unk>
There's nothing like that on the ground.
So according to it, TED was not founded in 1984 <unk> C.
Do the ideas really actually started in 1984 B.C. C.
It certainly puts <unk> in perspective.
Thank you very much.
Thank you.
I want to invite you to close your eyes.
Imagine standing out in front of the door of <unk> home.
I'd like you to pay attention to the color of the door, the material that is made.
Now we had a group of obese <unk> in bikes, bikes, <unk>
You're competing in a <unk> race and go into the <unk>
I need you to see this <unk>
They are <unk> strong, they're <unk> they're <unk>
And they collide against the door of their house.
There are bicycles flying everywhere, wheels that goes on on their side, rays from the wheels that end up in <unk> places -- the threshold of the door.
To the lobby, to the hall, or what there is on the other side of the door, and watch the quality of the light, the light shining on the <unk> of the <unk>
He is waving with the hand.
From his chair, on a brown horse.
It's a horse that is speech.
You can feel your blue <unk> you can tickle your nose.
You can smell the <unk> and you go to you that it's about to get into the mouth.
It goes on one side and go to their living room.
It's already in the room, and making use of his imagination, imagine Britney <unk>
It's with little clothes, dancing on his center <unk> singing <unk> One More <unk>
Now <unk>
The ground has been covered with a <unk> path of brick and from the oven, come to you <unk> Man of <unk> the <unk> and the title of "The Wizard of <unk> <unk> <unk>
Okay. Open your eyes.
I want to tell you about a peculiar contest that takes every spring in New York.
It's called the <unk> <unk>
I went to cover this event a few years ago as a <unk> journalist, I suppose, that this was like the end of a <unk> <unk>
There were several men and a few different ages and different habits of sanitation.
They were <unk> hundreds of numbers, look at them just once.
They put the names of tens and tens of strangers.
It <unk> poems in just minutes.
<unk> to see who he could memorize the <unk> order of a deck of <unk>
And I was thinking, "This is <unk>
These people must be phenomena.
And I started talking with some of the competitors.
This is a man named Ed <unk> who had come from England and he has one of the best memories <unk>
I said, <unk> when you realized that you were a <unk>
Ed <unk> "I'm not a wise.
Actually, I have a average memory.
All the ones that participate in this competition is they have normal memory.
We said, "We have been trained to perform these miraculous acts of memory using old old techniques ago, invented two thousand years ago in Greece, the same techniques that used <unk> to memorize their narratives -- and that academics were used for <unk> books.
And my reaction was, <unk> How did you have no heard of this <unk>
And we were standing out of the hall of competition, <unk> who is a wonderful and brilliant English -- although a little <unk> he said, <unk> you're an American journalist.
You know Britney <unk>
And I said, "What? No, why?
Because I would like to teach Britney <unk> how to memorize the order in a deck of <unk> live in national television in it.
That would show the world that anyone can do it."
And I said, "Well, I'm not Britney <unk> but maybe you can teach me to me.
I mean, you have to start for something not?"
And that was the start of a very strange journey for me.
I ended up spending most of the next year not just training my memory, but also <unk> trying to understand how it works, why sometimes it doesn't work and what its potential.
I met a lot of really interesting people.
This is a man named <unk>
He's <unk> very likely to the worst memory in the world.
Her memory was so bad that I didn't even remember that he had a <unk> problem.
Someone incredibly tragic, but it was a window that allows to see how far our memory makes us who we are.
On the other end of the spectrum I met this man.
This is Kim <unk> In the basis of <unk> <unk> in the movie <unk> <unk>
We spent a afternoon together in the public library from Salt Lake City, <unk> books, <unk> <unk> was <unk>
And to come back, I read a number of treaties on the memory written over 2,000 years ago in Latin, in <unk> and then in the Middle Ages.
And I learned a lot of really interesting things.
One of the most interesting things I learned is that there was a time when this idea of having a disciplined and disciplined <unk> and <unk> was not a thing as rare as it might look like today.
A long time ago, people invest in their memory, to provide <unk> their minds.
These techniques have made our modern world, but these techniques have been changed.
They have been <unk> and I would say that we have also changed cognitive disease.
As we almost don't have to remember, sometimes it seems like we've forgotten how to do it.
One of the last places on our planet where we are still passionate about this idea of a disciplined and disciplined memory and <unk> is this very unique competition of memory.
It's actually not that <unk> it's like this all over the world.
I was <unk> I wanted to know how they do these people.
A few years ago, a team of researchers at University College invited a group of memory champions to the lab.
They wanted to know: Is it going to have brains in some way, structural or <unk> different from the rest of us?
The answer was, no.
Are they smarter than the <unk>
They gave them a cognitive test battery and the answer was actually not.
There was yet a really interesting and significant difference between the brains of memory champions and the ones of control subjects with the <unk>
When they put them on an MRI machine, they put their brains while <unk> numbers, faces and forms of snow -- they found that in memory champions they are going to spread parts of the brain, different to others.
They were actually <unk> or they seemed <unk> a part of the brain that involves spatial memory and navigation.
Why? There's something we can learn from this?
The tournament in <unk> <unk> is driving as a armed career in where every year comes someone with a new way of remembering more things, and then the rest of the competitors should be <unk>
This is my friend Ben <unk> three times memory.
In his desk, in front of him, there is 36 <unk> of cards that he is about to try to memorize an hour, using a technique that he invented and only he <unk>
He used a similar technique to memorize the precise order of <unk> digits <unk>
In half an hour. Yeah.
And as there is a lot of ways to remember things in these <unk> absolutely all the techniques for the end is reduced to a single concept that psychologists call <unk> <unk>
It illustrates with a elegant paradox known as the <unk> <unk> <unk> says this: I say to two people who remember the same word. I say to you, <unk> that there's a man called <unk>
That's his <unk>
And then I'm asking you, <unk> that there's a <unk> <unk>
And when I go back later, and I asked them to tell you that word I told you about a <unk>
So what do you do?
The person who was told that their name is <unk> is unlikely to remember the same word that the person who was told that their work is <unk>
The same word, different capacity.
What happens here?
Well, the name Baker, actually doesn't mean nothing for you. It doesn't have any relationship to you.
With all the other memories that dance on his head.
But the word, <unk> We know <unk>
They use <unk> <unk>
They have <unk>
They were good when they go back home to work.
Probably <unk> some <unk>
And when you get that word for the first time, we started putting <unk> <unk> for <unk> <unk> at some given time.
One of the most elaborate techniques to do this data <unk> years ago in the Greece <unk>
It's known as the <unk> of <unk>
The story says this: There was a poet called <unk> who did a <unk>
They had hired as a entertainment, because it was before, if you wanted to give a very good party, you didn't get to a <unk> you get to a <unk>
He stood on foot, and he got her poem from memory, and he <unk> and so soon it was the room of the <unk> <unk>
<unk> everyone.
But not only killed them all of them, but it shattered the bodies.
No one could say who was there, no one could remember where you were sitting.
So they couldn't afford the <unk>
A tragedy behind the other.
He was standing out of standing out there, unique <unk> in the middle of the farthest ones, closed the eyes and realized that with the eyes of his mind, I could see where I was sitting every single one.
I took the family of the <unk> hand where they were their loved ones in the rubble of the rubble of it.
What we were looking at at that moment is something that we all know more or less <unk> and that no matter whether we are not good at remembering names or phone numbers or instructions from the word of our colleagues, we have visual and visual spatial memory.
If you were telling you that the first 10 words of the story I just told you about <unk> is very likely to be very difficult to do it.
But I would bet that if you ask you to say who I was sitting on the horse -- brown left in his lobby, would be able to <unk>
The idea of the palace of memory is to create this building with the eyes of his mind and <unk> of images with the things that you want to remember.
This is a advice that comes from over 2,000 years ago, to the first treaties of memory, in <unk>
And how does it work?
Let's say you were invited to the TED stage to give a talk and you want to make it memory in the same way that I would have done it -- if you had been invited by <unk> 2,000 years ago.
What you might do is imagine that you're at the door of your house.
And to come up with some kind of absolutely ridiculous, crazy and crazy image to help them remember that the first thing they want to mention is that completely <unk> competition.
And then you can imagine entering your house, and you can see the <unk> of the <unk> mounted on Mister <unk>
And that will remind you that they want to introduce your friend Ed <unk>
And then you would see Britney <unk> to remind you that funny anecdote that you want to count.
And then I turned in the kitchen, and the fourth issue that they talk about would be that strange journey that they did for a whole year, and they have some friends to help you remember it.
This is like speakers <unk> <unk> their narratives -- not a word by word, which is going to confuse us but typical by typical one.
In fact, the term <unk> comes from the Greek <unk> which means <unk>
It's a <unk> when people thought about <unk> and in the rhetoric with this kind of spatial terms.
The phrase <unk> first <unk> would be like the first place in his palace of memory.
I saw that this was just fascinating and I jumped in full of it.
I went to some of these memory skills, and I had the idea of writing something long about this <unk> <unk>
But there was a problem.
The problem was that a memory competition is a <unk> event.
Really, it's like to see a lot of people sitting at <unk> -- I mean, the most exciting thing that happens is when someone would get off the front.
I'm a journalist and I need to be able to write about something.
I know there are amazing things going on in the minds of these people, but I have no access.
I realized that if I was going to tell this story, I needed to try and put myself in place.
So I began to spend 15 or 20 minutes every morning, before I sit down to see the New York Times, just trying to remember something.
Maybe a poem. Or the names of an old school <unk> bought in a <unk> market.
And I discovered that this was a fun <unk>
I would never have expected it to do it.
It was fun, because it wasn't just about training memory.
What it's actually about doing is better and more the ability to create and imagine these images that are <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and hopefully <unk> in the eye of the mind.
I was quite struck by this.
This is me, using my standard training team for memory.
It's a couple of <unk> and some security glasses covered with tape by leaving just two <unk> because the distraction is the worst enemy of a memory.
And I ended up coming back in the same contest that I had covered a year before, and I had the idea that I could see it in a kind of <unk> experiment.
I thought this could be good <unk> for all my research.
The problem was that the experiment came out of control.
And I won the <unk> something that didn't have to happen.
Of course it's cute power to <unk> <unk> and phone numbers, but this is actually not the point.
These are just that only tricks.
Because they are based on very basic principles about how the brain works.
And you don't need to be building <unk> or <unk> <unk> <unk> to benefit from a little insights on how your mind works.
We often talk about people with a great memory as if it was a gift of <unk> but it's not the case.
The big memories are <unk>
The most basic level, we remember when we pay attention.
<unk> when we focus on deeply.
The palace of the <unk> These memory techniques are only shortcuts.
In fact, they're not even <unk>
They work because they make us <unk>
It would take a sort of deep processing -- a kind of complete care that most of them are not <unk> out there.
But the reality is that there are no shortcuts.
That's how things do <unk>
And if there is something I want to leave you with today, it's what I could not even remember that I couldn't even remember that I had a memory problem, I left me, which is the notion that life is the sum of our memories.
How much are we willing to lose what is already our <unk> existence in the <unk> or <unk> not paying attention to the human being in front of us, who walks into our side -- we're going to be so <unk> that we don't even stop in <unk>
I learned from the first hand that there are incredible memory capabilities in all of us.
But if you want to live a living, you must be the kind of person who remembers remember.
Thank you.
Today I'm going to talk to you about the last 30 years of the history of architecture.
It's a lot to cover in 18 minutes.
It's a complex issue, so you know, just a place that is <unk> New Jersey.
Because 30 years ago, I'm from <unk> Jersey, I was six years old and lived there in my parents in a town called <unk> and this was my <unk>
In the corner, from my bedroom, I was the bathroom that shared with my sister.
And between my bedroom and the bathroom, there was a balcony that gave the living room.
And there everybody spent the time watching television -- so every time I was going to go from my room to the bathroom, they all looked at me, and every time I got back, and I was wrapped in a <unk> I would all see me.
And I was like this.
It was <unk> not and hated it.
<unk> that journey hated that <unk> I hated that room and that house.
That's architecture.
That's right.
Those emotions that I felt, that's the power of architecture -- because architecture is not about mathematics, or <unk> of neighborhoods, but of those connections, emotional connections, that we feel in the places that <unk>
And it's no wonder that we feel like this, because according to the <unk> Protection Agency -- Americans spend 90 percent of their time under roof.
I mean, 90 percent of the time are surrounded by architecture.
That's a lot.
architecture determines it in ways we don't even realize it.
That makes us a little naive and very, very predictable.
So this means when I show you a building like this, I know what you are thinking about, think about <unk> <unk> and <unk>
And I know that they think about based on a building built two thousand years ago by the Greeks.
This is a trick.
It's a <unk> that they use architects to create an emotional connection with the ways we build our buildings.
It's an emotional connection -- we have used this trick for a long time, a long time.
We used it 200 years ago to build banks.
We used it in the 19th century to build art.
And in the 20th century, we use it to build homes.
Look, these <unk> stable, <unk> <unk> in front of the elements.
This is very, very helpful, because building things is terrifying.
It's expensive, it takes a long time and it's very complicated.
People who are <unk> and governments are always afraid of innovation, and they prefer to use ways that they know they're going to work.
So we found ourselves with buildings like this.
It's a nice <unk>
This is the Public Library of <unk> which was ended in 2004, in my hometown, and, you know, he has a <unk> he has this kind of swimming thing, columns, red brick -- that leave <unk> what they <unk> tries to communicate with this <unk> kids, the values of property, the story.
But it doesn't have a lot to do with a library today.
That same year in 2004, the other side of the country, ended up another library, which looks like this.
It's in Seattle.
This library shows how we use media media in the digital era.
It's a new kind of public equipment for the city, a place to come together, read and share.
So how is it possible in the same year, in the same country, two buildings, both so-called libraries, are so completely different?
And the answer is that architecture works on the beginning of the <unk>
On one side is <unk> architects who constantly drive new technologies, new solutions -- new solutions for the forms of current life.
We gave them <unk> and we get so much away from the people.
All of black, this is <unk> you think we feel very well, but we're dead in because we have no choice.
We need to go to the other side and go back and connect with those symbols <unk>
So we do that, and we're all happy, but we feel like <unk> so we started to experience the <unk> we go ahead and go ahead and over and over and over and over and over and over again, we have done it in the last 30 years.
Well, 30 years ago from the '70s.
The architects were busy experimenting with so-called <unk>
It has to do with the concrete.
You can guess.
<unk> small, <unk> scale.
It's really very hard.
So we are approaching the '80s, and we started bringing those symbols.
It was <unk> the <unk> of the other direction.
We take those ways we know and <unk>
<unk> <unk> and we added some of them and we use new materials.
They love it.
We don't give <unk>
We take <unk> and we turned them into skyscraper, that they can be <unk> <unk> <unk>
The shapes were <unk> won in audacity and <unk>
The <unk> became columns.
<unk> grew up to the size of buildings.
It's crazy.
But it was the 1980s, that was great.
We all spent the time in business centers, we moved to the slums, and there in the suburbs, we can create our own <unk>
Those fantasies could be <unk> to the French or the Italian one.
Maybe with a <unk> of bread.
This is what happens to the <unk>
This is what happens with the symbols.
They're easy, they're cheap, because instead of creating new spaces, we see memories of other places.
I know very well, and you all know this is not the <unk>
This is Ohio.
The architects are frustrated and we began to swing the <unk> again in the other direction.
In the 1980s and early '90s, we started to experiment with so-called <unk>
<unk> the symbols <unk> now we have new design techniques for computer design, and we found ourselves with new <unk> a few ways that are <unk> against other forms.
This is academic and <unk> and it's super <unk> you get totally <unk>
Typically, the <unk> <unk> in the opposite direction.
But then something happened to happen.
In 1997, he opened this building.
It's the <unk> of Frank <unk>
This building changed the relationship of the world with architecture.
Paul <unk> said that Bilbao was one of those rare moments and <unk> and public public and general public were completely aware of a building.
The New York Times <unk> this <unk> construction.
The tourism, in Bilbao grew up in a 2,500 percent, when they finished the building.
So all of a sudden, everybody wanted one of those <unk> Los Angeles, Seattle, Chicago, New York, Cleveland,
Everybody wanted one, and Gehry was everywhere.
He was our first architect in star.
But how is it possible that these wild forms and <unk> how it is possible to become ubiquitous around the world?
And it happened, because the media was <unk> around them, and we quickly learned that those forms meant culture and fast.
We've created an emotional reaction with these forms.
Same thing did the major mayors in the world.
So everybody believed that if they had these forms, they had culture and <unk>
This is the beginning of the beginning of the new country with other star.
He went to <unk> and <unk> and what happened with these few elite architects at the threshold of the new millennium, actually started going through the entire architecture, digital media began to increase the speed of information consumption.
Think of it, for example, how about architecture.
A thousand years ago, they would have to have walked up to the next town to see a building.
The transportation <unk> can take a boat, an airplane, can be <unk>
<unk> technology can be seen in the newspapers, on TV, and in the end, we are all photographers in architecture, and the building goes beyond its physical location.
The architecture is everywhere right now, that means that the speed of communications finally has reached the speed of architecture.
Because architecture is moving so fast, by the time.
It's not accurate enough to think about a building.
You need a lot of time to build a building, three or four years, and in that time, an architect can design two, eight, or 100 buildings more -- before we know whether that I designed four years ago was a success or not.
Because there's never been good feedback in architecture.
This is how we found ourselves with buildings like this.
The <unk> was not about two years, but 20 years.
For 20 years, we were building buildings like this because we had no idea how much the <unk>
That's never going to happen to happen, because we're at the threshold of the largest revolution in architecture from the invention of the <unk> steel or <unk> and it's the media revolution.
My theory is that when it applies to the media, the media, starts to swing faster and faster, to get to be in both extremes almost in <unk> and actually <unk> the difference between innovation and symbol, between us, the architects, and you, the public.
Now we can make symbols almost <unk> with emotional payload of something completely new.
Let me show you how the system works in a project that my company ended up recently.
We were <unk> to replace this building that is <unk>
This is the center of a town called <unk> <unk> in the state of New York.
It's a vacation.
But that meant that two years before the building, it was already part of the community. And like the drawings looked at exactly the finished, done, there was no surprises.
The building came to be part of the community. That first summer, when people started to get and share it in social media, the building stopped being a building, and it became a media, because these are not just images of a building, it's the images that you have made of the building.
And as you use it to tell your story, they become part of the personal narrative -- and that makes it <unk> with collective memory, and when you can charge these symbols, we learn.
I mean, we don't need the Greeks tell us how to think about architecture.
We can tell each other what we think about architecture, because digital media has not only changed the relationship between us, but they have changed the relationship between us and buildings.
Think about a second in those librarians of <unk>
If that building is built today, first of us would go to the Internet in search of <unk> <unk>
<unk> bombarded with examples of interacting with innovation, about what a library.
That's <unk>
<unk> that can lead to the mayor of <unk> people in <unk> and tell them that there is no unique response to what a library might be today.
Let's be part of this.
This abundance of solutions gives to experience.
Everything is different now.
The architects are no longer those mysterious creatures that use <unk> words and complicated, and you're no longer a <unk> public that doesn't have something that hasn't seen before.
The architects can listen, and you don't leave it by the architecture.
That means that the <unk> <unk> from one style to another, from one movement to another, is irrelevant.
In fact, we can go ahead and find right solutions to the problems facing society.
This is the end of the history of architecture, and it means that buildings in the morning will be very different from the buildings today.
This means that a public space in the ancient city of <unk> can be unique and adapted to the measure of a modern city.
This means that a stadium in Brooklyn can be that, a stadium in Brooklyn, and not a bad historical historical historic brick of red brick based on ideas of what has to be a <unk>
This means that a few robots can build our buildings, because we will finally be ready for the shapes that are going to produce.
That means that the buildings <unk> the <unk> of nature and not the opposite.
This means a garage, a parking lot in Miami in Beach, Florida, can also serve to do sports or for <unk> or even one can marry the night.
This means three architects can dream of swimming on the East East <unk> in New York, and to raise half a million dollars of the community tied around that cause, it's no one customer alone.
It means that no building is too small for innovation, like this little <unk> pavilion and <unk> and <unk> like the animals that are going to observe.
Because no matter whether it's a cow or a robot who builds our buildings.
It doesn't matter how we built, which matters what we build.
The architects already know how to make buildings more intelligent, smarter and more kind.
We have been waiting for all of you to want.
Finally, we're not on the opposite side.
Find an architect, <unk> and <unk> together to make better buildings, better cities, for a better world, because there's a lot in play.
The buildings not only reflect our society, but they shape the more <unk> spaces in the world, the local libraries where we form our children, and the step in the bathroom.
Thank you very much.
This is my <unk> <unk>
It just turned a year and started walking.
And it does this very cool way of the children in a year, <unk> as if their body was moving too fast for their legs.
It's totally <unk>
And one of the things that you like to do for the moment is look at it in the mirror.
She really loves his <unk>
<unk> and <unk> and it gives itself those <unk> <unk> <unk>
It's beautiful.
And to look at all of your friends do this, and my mom tells me I used to do it, and I would think, When did I stop doing this?
How do we suddenly be comfortable with our <unk>
Because, apparently, we don't like it.
Every month, 10,000 people are looking at something like, "I'm <unk>
This is <unk> it's 13 years old and lives in <unk>
And as any teenager just want to be dear and fit in.
It's Sunday at night.
It's preparing for next week in school.
It has a bit of fear, it's a bit confused because, even though his mom tells him all the time it's beautiful, every day in school, somebody tells you it's ugly.
Among what his mom tells him and what his friends, or fellow of the school would say, doesn't know who believe.
So a video of her itself, he runs it on YouTube, and he asks others to leave a <unk> "I'm nice or I'm <unk>
Well, so far, <unk> has received over 13,000 comments.
Some of these are so <unk> it's not even worth thinking about them.
We talk about a healthy healthy teenager, which gets these answers in one of the most vulnerable life stages of emotionally.
Thousands of people are publishing videos like this, mostly teenage girls trying to communicate this way.
But what are you doing this?
Well, the teenagers today are almost not alone.
They're under pressure to be online and available all the time, talking, <unk> giving me <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> -- this is never over.
Never before we've been so connected, in a continuous way, so young.
As a mother said, "It's like there's a party in your room all the <unk>
There's simply no privacy.
And the social pressures that go from hand with that are <unk>
This environment, of being always connected to our children to <unk> based on the number they liked that they have and the kinds of comments that they do.
There is no division between a online life and real life.
It's really hard to know the differences between what it's real or what it isn't.
And also, it's very hard to know the difference between what is authentic and what is normal.
What is the best in somebody's life in front of what it's normal in a context every day?
And where are they looking for <unk>
Well, you can see the kind of images that are <unk> from the news of girls now.
<unk> <unk> keep losing our <unk>
The <unk> technique is now routine.
And trends like, <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk>
For those of you that <unk> <unk> means <unk>
These trends are associated with women in the popular culture today.
It's not hard to see with what young people are.
But the kids are not immune to this.
Like the crude stars in the sport, and the singers down.
But what is the problem with all this?
Well, we certainly want our children to grow healthy and be individuals.
But in a culture obsessed with the image, we're teaching our children to spend more time and effort mental effort to look at the price of all the other aspects of their identity.
Things like their relationships, the development of their physical capacities -- their studies and other aspects begin to suffer from.
Six in 10 girls want to do something because they think they don't see nice enough.
These are not <unk>
They are fundamental activities for growth as human beings, and how they bring into society and the field of labor development.
31 percent, almost one in three teenagers are not interested in the lecture debates -- they would be involved in the classroom debates because they don't want to call attention by their physical shape.
One in five are not coming to class at all the days for days when they don't feel comfortable about it.
And in the testing season, if you don't think you can see you good enough -- well, specifically if you don't think you're good enough -- a smaller note at the average of your fellow who don't care about it as appearance.
And this phenomenon has been widespread in both the United States and China.
It realizes regardless of what they actually weigh these young people.
So, to be very clear of course, we're talking about how you see you not about how you really are.
The low self-esteem on its body is <unk> academic performance.
And it's also <unk>
<unk> with little self-esteem do less physical activity, they eat fewer fruits and vegetables, engaging in more diet not healthy that can take you to a food mess.
They have low self-esteem.
They are more easily influenced by the people around them and they're much more risk of depression.
And we think it's all about this because of what they make more disruptive decisions like the consumption of alcohol and drug consumption -- diet, aesthetic activity, sexual relationships at early ages and protection and harm.
The search for the perfect body is pushing the health care system, and our government costs billions of dollars every year.
And we're not <unk>
Women who believe they're overweight again, again, regardless of whether or they have no higher rates of <unk>
Fifty percent of women are not presented to an interview interview in a day where they don't feel safe with the way you see it.
Think about a moment in what this is doing to our economy.
So if we could overcome this, what would that be like that way?"
<unk> this potential is of interest for each of us.
But how do we do that?
Well, speaking, it doesn't take you very far.
It's not enough.
If you really want to change things, you have to do something.
And we've learned that there are three key ways. The first is that we have to raise trust in your own body.
We need to help our teenagers to develop strategies to overcome the pressure of the perfect images and build their self-esteem.
The good news is that there are many programs available to do it.
The bad news is that most of these don't work.
I was very surprised when I learned that a lot of <unk> programs without realizing the situation.
So we have to make sure that the program that our children follow our children will not only have a positive impact, but also a <unk> impact.
And research studies show that the best programs are focused on six key areas, the first is the influence of family, friends and relationships.
These six aspects are very important points to anyone willing to provide education in body self-esteem that works.
One education is fundamental -- but address this problem requires each of us to take through the address and we're a better model to follow women and girls in our own lives.
The current status of how women are seen and talked about our circles.
It's not good to have the contribution of our politicians in <unk> or the size of its <unk> or <unk> that determination or success of an Olympic athlete depends on the fact that it's not a great beauty.
We need to start to judge people by what they are, not as you see.
All of us can start by making the responsibility for the kind of images and comments that we published in our social networks.
We can get people based on their effort and their actions and not in their appearance.
And let me ask you, When was the last time you could <unk> a <unk>
In short, we have to work together as communities, as governments and as companies, to truly change our culture, so that our children will grow to be valuing their entire person to trade their diversity, the diversity, the <unk>
We need to put people who are really making the difference in a <unk>
To make a difference in the real world, let's make them be the ones that come out on the big screen because we just will create a different world.
A world where our children are free to become the best version of themselves, where the way they believe that they are never seeing the <unk> of being who they are, or to reach what they want in their lives.
Think about what this can mean for someone in your lives.
Who have in mind?
His <unk>
His <unk>
His <unk>
His <unk> A <unk>
It could just be the woman who is at two seats away. What would it mean for her if he was liberated from that <unk> voice in his inner voice, which was <unk> by not having long legs -- <unk> <unk> feet more <unk>
What would it mean for her if we were to <unk> this and help his potential for that way?
Right now, the obsession of our culture with the images is getting rid of us all.
But let's take our children the truth.
And I think the way you see it is just a part of your identity, and that the truth is that we love them are and so they do, and because of how they make us feel.
It would take the self-esteem in the <unk> of our schools.
Let's change each of us, the way we talk about and compared to other people.
And <unk> together as a community, from small groups to governments, so that the small <unk> of a year of today, will become themselves safe for themselves tomorrow.
Let's do it.
On June 5 in 1990, a gentleman named <unk> <unk> walked into a hotel in Manhattan and he killed the rabbi <unk> <unk> the leader of the League of Defense <unk>
To <unk> they initially saw the innocent but a prisoner for other minor charges in company of others, started planning attacks at about 12 New York, including <unk> <unk> and the United Nations.
Fortunately, those plans <unk> by an informant from the FBI.
Sadly, the bomb of 1993 in the World Trade Center, couldn't be <unk>
Later on, he would be convicted of his participation in that <unk>
<unk> <unk> is my father.
I was born in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, in 1983, being an engineer <unk> with a loving mother, American school, between the two <unk> to give me a happy childhood,
Only when I was seven years old, our family started to change.
My father taught me a way of Islam, that a few, even most Muslims get to meet.
In fact, I saw that when people take time to deal with, you don't need a lot to get to want the same things in life.
However, in all religion, in all of human group, there is always a little fraction of people who are <unk> so <unk> to their convictions that thinks you have to use all the means possible for everybody to live as them.
A few months before the arrest he sat with me and explained to me that in the last weekends he and a few friends, he had been doing training on Long Island, to practice to practice.
He told me that I would go with him the next day.
We got to the <unk> <unk> which, without knowing our group, was <unk> by the FBI.
When I was <unk> my father helped me hold the <unk> on my shoulder and explained to me how to point at about 30 meters.
That day, with the last bullet he shot him at the little white light on the goal and to surprise everybody, especially from me, all the goal on fire.
My uncle turned to the other and in Arabic, he said, <unk> <unk>
From such a father, that child.
All of all, the comment gave them a lot of laughter, but only a few years later I understood what they were so funny.
Did you see me in me, the same level of destruction that my father could <unk>
Those people later would be committed to putting a stick with 700 pounds.
I admired those men.
He called them <unk> which means uncle.
When I was 19, 19, I had moved 20 times -- that instability during my childhood was not allowed to do a lot of <unk>
Every time I started to feel comfortable about someone was time to pack and go to another city.
As I was always the new face of the class often was a victim of <unk>
<unk> secret my identity to prevent the white. But to be the new class of the class, silent and <unk> was enough <unk>
So most of the time I was walking home at home reading books, watching TV or playing video games.
For these reasons not developed social skills, to say it <unk> <unk> <unk> was not prepared for the real world.
I became an opera <unk> to judge people, based on indicators -- like race or religion.
So how could I open the eyes?
One of the first experiences they put in test my way to think, was during the presidential elections in 2000.
In a <unk> program that I was involved in the National Convention in Philadelphia.
My group <unk> in juvenile violence -- as I had been a victim of <unk> almost all my life, was something that I felt a lot of passion.
The members of this group came from diverse <unk>
One day, at the end of the <unk> I discovered that one of the kids who we had done friendship, was Jewish people.
I took a number of days to get out of light, and I realized that there was no <unk> between the two.
I had never had a Jewish friend of mine and frankly I felt very proud to have been able to beat the barrier that all life had been made to me to believe that it was <unk>
Another crucial moment came when I got a summer job in Bush -- a <unk> park.
I found myself with people from all sorts of beliefs and cultures. That experience was fundamental in the development of my character.
All of the life had been taught to me that the <unk> was a sin and <unk> all gay people were bad <unk>
I had a chance to work with gay actors there, in a show, and I could see that several of them were the most nice and less critics who had seen in life.
Having been a child, I developed a sense of empathy to the suffering of others, but it wasn't easy for me to deal with people, in the way I would have to be treated.
So I was able to contrast the stereotypes that I had taught me as a child, with the experience of interaction in real life.
I don't know what it is about being <unk> but I know what is going to be <unk> something beyond my control.
Then he came up with the <unk> <unk>
Every night, Jon Stewart made me be <unk> honest about my <unk> and he helped me see that the race of people, religion or sexual orientation have nothing to do with character.
In many ways, he became my figure in a moment when I was desperately <unk>
In occasion, the inspiration can come from the unexpected and a Jewish comedian would have had a better influence in my life than my father -- <unk> was not in vain.
One day I had a conversation with my mother about how I was changing my way to think, and she told me something to keep on my heart forever, as he is alive.
She looked at me with my eyes tired of somebody who has suffered enough with never-ending <unk> and he said, "I'm tired of <unk>
At that point, I realized how much negative energy is needed to keep all of that hatred inside.
My real name is not <unk> <unk>
It changed when my family decided to break my relationship with my father and start a new life.
So why I decided to go out and put myself in a possible risk?
Well, it's simple.
I've done it because I hope that someone, one day, who is about to take care of violence -- I can hear my story and understand that there's a better way. That even though I was obsessed with this violent ideology.
On the contrary, I decided to use my experience to fight terrorism and against prejudice.
I do it by the victims of terrorism and for their loved ones. For the terrible pain and the losses that terrorism has produced them in their lives.
By the victims of terrorism victims talking against those meaningless acts like rejection to the actions of my father.
With this simplicity I put up here as proof that violence is not inherent to any religion or race. That children don't have to follow the paths of their parents.
I'm not my father.
Thank you.  Thank you all.  Thank you.
At this point, there's a film that is projects in their minds.
It's an amazing <unk>
It's in 3D and it has <unk> sound of what you hear and see right now, but that's just the beginning.
Your film is <unk> flavor and texture.
It feels your body, your pain, your hunger, your pleasure.
It has emotions, anger and happiness.
It's got memories, like moments of childhood that you project in front of your eyes.
And it has constantly a superimposed voice in your conscious thought.
The heart of the movie is you experience everything.
This film is your conscience, the subject of the experience of mind and the world.
consciousness is one of the fundamental truths of the existence of being human.
Each of us is conscious.
We all have an internal film, and you and you.
There is nothing that would be more directly.
At least, I know I have a <unk>
I don't know that you are aware of.
consciousness is also the reason to live.
If we are not aware of it, nothing in our lives would make sense or value.
But at the same time it's the most mysterious phenomenon of the universe.
Why are we <unk>
Why do we have these films <unk>
Why are we not just robots that we're going to get to produce results without experiencing the movie <unk>
Right now, nobody knows the answers to those questions.
I suggest that to integrate consciousness to science, you need some radical ideas.
Some people say it's impossible a science of consciousness.
Science for nature, is objective to objective it.
<unk> for nature, is <unk>
So there can never be a science of consciousness.
Because for almost all the 20th century, we would take that vision.
The psychology was studying behavioral behavior, and the neuroscience was studying the brain -- but no one mentioned consciousness.
Even 30 years ago, when TED started, there were very few scientists in consciousness.
<unk> 20 years ago, all started to change.
<unk> like Francis Crick and physicists like Roger <unk> said, <unk> is the time for science to <unk> the <unk>
And since then, there was a real bang, a <unk> of scientific work about consciousness.
And this work was fantastic. It was great.
But it also has fundamental limitations to the moment.
The center of the awareness of consciousness in the recent years was the pursuit of <unk> correlations between some areas of the brain and some states of consciousness.
We saw something about this guy in the fantastic work that I presented Nancy <unk> a few minutes.
Now we understand a lot better, for example, the areas of the brain that are related to the conscious experience of seeing faces or feeling pain or feeling happy.
But this is still a science of <unk>
It's not a science.
We know that these areas of the brain are related to certain kinds of conscious experiences, but we don't know why.
I would like to explain that this kind of work of neuroscience responds to some questions that we want to explain consciousness. And the questions about what certain things are doing as certain areas of the brain and what they <unk>
But in a sense, those are the easy problems.
<unk> <unk>
In fact, there's no easy problems with consciousness.
Well it doesn't address the real central mystery of this <unk> why all the physical process in the brain has to be accompanied by slavery.
Why is there a movie <unk>
At this point, we can't understand it.
And you can say, let's give it a few years to the neuroscience.
It's going to become another emerging phenomenon like <unk> like <unk> like life, and we're going to find explanation.
The typical <unk> are all of the emerging behaviors, how they operate the <unk> how they work <unk> how they <unk> are adapting and <unk> living organisms.
That could be applied to the human brain to explain some behaviors and the functions of the human brain as a <unk> phenomenon, how we speak, how we speak, how we play <unk> they're all questions about behavior.
But when it comes to consciousness, questions about behavior are between easy problems.
But the hard problem is the question of why all of the behavior is accompanied by a <unk> experience.
And here it is, the standard paradigm of <unk> the standard paradigm of neuroscience, actually doesn't have a lot to say.
I am a spark of a heart.
I want a scientific theory of <unk> that will work. For a long time, I would hit my head against a theory of consciousness in pure terms that would work.
But at the end I came to the conclusion that that didn't work for <unk> reasons.
I think we're going to get on this point.
We have a chain of wonderful explanations -- great. We get used to this, physics explains chemistry, chemistry explains biology, biology explains a part of psychology.
But consciousness doesn't seem to fit in this scheme.
On the one hand, it's a fact that we are aware of.
On the other, we don't know how to work that idea to our scientific vision of the world.
I think that consciousness right now, is sort of a <unk> something that we need to integrate our worldview, but we don't know how.
With an anomaly like this, you can need radical ideas -- I think we need ideas that we need to talk about, <unk> before we deal with consciousness in a scientific way.
There are some possibilities for those crazy ideas.
My friend Dan Dennett, who's here today has one.
His crazy idea is that there is no such problem hard for consciousness.
All the idea of the subjective film, it includes a kind of illusion or confusion.
Actually, what you have to do, is to explain behavioral functions -- the behaviors of the brain, and so you study everything that you need explanation.
Well, more power for him.
That's the kind of radical idea that we need to explore if we want to have a theory of purely <unk> <unk> based on the brain.
At the same time, for me and for many others, that vision is pretty close to simply to deny that the observation of consciousness is satisfying to be true.
But I go in a different direction.
In the time, I want to explore two crazy ideas that I think can be <unk>
The first crazy idea is that consciousness is critical.
physicists are sometimes taking some aspects of the universe as bricks and bricks and space and mass.
It makes fundamental laws that are <unk> like the laws of gravity or quantum mechanics.
These laws and fundamental properties are not explain in terms of anything more basic.
Instead, you look at fundamental principles, and there you look at the world.
Sometimes, the list of the fundamental list is <unk>
In the 19th century -- <unk> found that you can't explain the electromagnetic phenomena in terms of fundamental concepts in terms of the space -- time -- family laws -- so I applied the basic laws of <unk> and <unk> the electric charge as a fundamental concept that those laws <unk>
I think that's the situation we find in consciousness.
If you can't explain consciousness in terms of fundamental ideas -- the space -- time -- time -- hot -- so that we have to call it the list.
The most natural thing would be <unk> as a fundamental thing, a fundamental brick of nature.
This doesn't mean that suddenly it's not the object of science.
It opens up the way to <unk> scientifically.
So what we need is to study the fundamental laws that govern consciousness, the laws that connect consciousness to other fundamental concepts space, the space, the mass, the mass of physical processes.
physicists sometimes say that we want fundamental laws that we can do in a <unk>
The situation of consciousness is something like this.
We want to find fundamental laws so simple that we can put them into a t-shirt.
We don't know what laws are, but that's what we're looking for.
The second crazy idea is that consciousness can be universal.
Every system can have a degree of consciousness.
This vision is sometimes called <unk> <unk> by all of us, <unk> by mind, every system is conscious -- not just humans, dogs, mice, flies, flies even the microbes from Rob <unk> the elementary particles.
Even a <unk> has some degree of consciousness.
The idea is not that photons are smart or <unk>
It's not that a <unk> can be full of distress when he thinks "Oh, I always travel at the speed of light.
I can never slow down and smell the <unk>
No, no.
But the thought is that maybe photons can have some powerful element of feeling <unk> some primitive precursor to consciousness.
This may sound a little crazy for you.
How would anyone think such <unk>
In part of this comes from the first crazy idea, that consciousness is critical.
If it's <unk> like space, time and mass is natural -- assume that it can also be universal, just like others.
It's also worth noticing that even though the idea seems to us, it's much less for the people in different cultures, where the human mind seems more a continuum to nature.
One more profound reason comes from the idea that perhaps the simplest form and powerful laws of finding fundamental laws that require thinking about thinking about the physical process, it's <unk> consciousness with information.
Because there is always information processing -- there is consciousness.
<unk> of complex <unk> as in a human being.
<unk> simple information, simple information.
So something very exciting is that in the recent years, a neuroscientist, <unk> <unk> took this kind of theory, and I developed <unk> <unk>
It has a mathematical measure of information integration of information, which is called <unk> which measures the degree of information in a system.
And I'm supposed to do with consciousness.
So in a human brain, there's an incredible degree of integration of information, a high degree of <unk> a lot of consciousness.
In a mouse there is a <unk> of information integration, just as significant as significant consciousness to quite important.
But when you get to the details, microbes, particles, the degree of <unk> <unk>
The level of information integration is small, but it's not zero either.
In <unk> theory, there will still be a level of a different consciousness of zero.
In fact, by giving a fundamental law of <unk> <unk> <unk> of consciousness.
Also, another reason is that <unk> can help us integrate consciousness into the physical world.
physicists and philosophers often have observed that physics is curiously abstract.
It describes the structure of reality using a lot of equations, but we don't talk about the reality underlying the reality underlying us.
As Stephen Hawking, "Where is the fire of the <unk>
From <unk> vision, the equations of physics can be used as they are, but you can use to describe the flow of consciousness.
That's what physicists do basically describe the flow of consciousness.
According to this vision, consciousness is the one that puts fire in the equations.
In that vision, consciousness is not found out of the physical world as a kind of <unk>
It's right in the center.
This vision, I think, <unk> vision has the potential to <unk> our relationship with nature, and it can have social and ethical and ethical consequences.
Some can be <unk>
I used to think that I didn't have to eat anything that had consciousness, then I should be a <unk>
If you're a <unk> and you accept that vision, you'll have a lot of hunger.
I think it tends to transform your <unk> while what matters in ethical terms, and moral <unk> is not so much the fact of consciousness, but its importance and complexity.
It's also natural to ask for consciousness in other systems, like computers.
What about the artificial intelligence system of Samantha <unk>
It's <unk>
According to the vision of <unk> information, she has a complicated information processing so that the answer is yes, if it's conscious.
If this is the right thing, they are very serious ethical problems about the development of the development of intelligent computers and the ethics <unk>
Finally, you can ask you for the consciousness of <unk> <unk> the planet.
Canada has its own <unk>
Or a more local level, an integrated group like the audience at a TED talk, and we have a collective consciousness -- an internal consciousness for this whole group of TED, different from the internal movies of each of the <unk>
I don't know the answer to that question, but I think at least a question you have to take seriously.
So this <unk> <unk> is a radical view, and I don't know if it's right.
I'm actually safer from the first crazy idea that consciousness is a fundamental thing, which is a fundamental thing.
The vision raises a lot of questions, a lot of challenges, like, how those bits of thinking contribute to the kind of complex awareness we know and we love.
If we can answer those questions, then I think we go on the right path to a theory of serious awareness.
If not, well, it's probably the most difficult problem of science and philosophy.
We can't wait to solve the night in the morning.
But I think we're finally going to be able to find it out.
Understanding consciousness is the real key, I think, to understand the universe and to understand ourselves.
Maybe we just need the crazy idea.
Thank you.
I grew up in a small rural village in Victoria.
He had a very normal profile, a low profile of education.
I went to school, and I was obsessed with my friends, <unk> me with my younger sisters.
Everything was very normal.
And when I was 15 years old, a member of my community came up to my parents because I wanted to do it for a community prize.
And my parents said, "Well, that's very nice -- but there's a problem obvious.
She was actually not <unk>  And they were right.
I went to school, I had good grades. After school, I had a low profile in my mother, and I spent a long time looking at the <unk> <unk> the <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk>
Yeah, I know. What a contradiction.
But they were right.
I didn't do anything that was extraordinary at all.
Nothing that can be considered as a achievement if we take the disability out of the equation.
Years later, I was in the second part of teaching in a high school of <unk> as only after about 20 minutes in the middle of the 11 minutes -- a guy raised his hand and said, "Hey, when will you give you your <unk>
And I said, "What do you do?
Well, I had been talking to you about the <unk> law for good 20 minutes.
And he said, "You know, your <unk> speech.
When people in chairs of wheels, they talk about things in school?"
Usually in the classroom.
And that's when I realized, this kid had had experiences with disabled people as inspiration.
And we don't are. And it's not about the boy, I mean, that's true for many of us.
For us, people with disability are not our teachers or our doctors or our <unk>
We're not real people. We're there to inspire me.
And in fact, I'm on this stage, I think what I do in this wheelchair, and you're probably waiting for them to be <unk> Right?  Yeah.
Well, ladies and gentlemen, I'm afraid I am <unk>
I'm not here to <unk>
I'm here to tell you that you have lied to disability.
Yes, they have sold the lie that disability is something <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
It's something bad and living with a disability makes you remarkable.
It's not something wrong and you can't make a fantastic make you remarkable.
And in the last few years, we've been able to spread even more of this lie through social media.
You may have seen images like this: "The only disability in life is a bad <unk>
Or this <unk> "Your excuse <unk> <unk>
Or this <unk> "Before <unk> <unk>
These are just a couple of examples, but there's a lot of them.
It may be that you've seen one, from the girl with no hand drawing with a pencil holding out of the mouth.
You may have seen a child running with carbon fiber <unk>
And there's a lot of these pictures, which are what we call <unk> <unk>
And I use the term porn <unk> because we would take a group of people to the benefit from another group of people.
So in this case, we would get to the disabled people who have no disability.
The purpose of these images is <unk> <unk> so we can see them and think, "Well, because of a bad thing to be my life, it could be worse.
I could be that person.
But if you're that person?
I've lost the number of the number of times that I've been dealing with strange <unk> to express that they believe I'm brave or a source of inspiration, and this was happening before my work had a public profile.
It was kind of like me to get up in the morning and remember my own name.  And this is <unk>
These pictures, those images that are <unk> people with disabled people in the benefit of people with no disability.
They're there for you to see them and think that things are not so bad for you, or to put their concerns in perspective.
And life as a disabled person is actually a tough thing.
We would have a few things.
But the things that we have -- are not the things that you can think about.
They're not relative to our bodies.
I use the term <unk> <unk> deliberately because I was calling to the so-called social model of disabilities, which tells us that we are more disabled because of the society that we live in due to our bodies or diagnosis.
So I've lived in this body for a long time.
I'm very <unk> with him.
It makes the things that I need to do, and I've learned to get the best of your capacity as well as you do, and that's what happens to the children of those pictures as well.
They're not doing anything outside the common.
They just are using their bodies by taking the best of their ability.
So, it's really just just <unk> in the way we do that, by sharing those <unk>
When people say, "You're a source of <unk> it says it as a compliment.
And I know why it happens.
It's because of the lie, because we have sold this lie that the disability makes us quite remarkable.
And honestly, he doesn't do it.
And I know what you're thinking.
I'm here <unk> the inspiration and you're thinking, "Oh my God, <unk> you're not sometimes inspired by something like this.
And actually, I know I am.
<unk> of other people with disability at all time.
However, I don't know that I am so lucky to them.
<unk> that this is a great idea to use <unk> <unk> to pick up the things that they fall over.  <unk> the clever trick of how to load your battery battery battery on your chair.
Great.
We learn about force and resilience of others, not against our bodies and our <unk> but against a world that we <unk> and <unk> us.
I really think that that lie that they have sold us about disability is the greatest <unk>
It makes us hard life.
And that quote: "The only disability in life is a bad <unk> the reason that that's lie to be is not true because of the social model of disability.
A lot of smiles to a stretch of stairs has never been done in a <unk>
Never.    <unk> to a television screen won't make the <unk> for people <unk>
Not a lot of people in the middle of a bookstore and <unk> a positive attitude to turn all those books into the <unk>
It's just not going to happen.
I want to really live in a world where disability is not the exception, but the norm.
I want to live where a 15 year-old girl sitting in his bedroom watching <unk> the <unk> <unk> not considered nothing to be on a chair.
I want to live in a world where we don't have so low expectations of people who have disability to be <unk> by getting out of bed and remember our names in the morning.
I want to live in a world where you value the genuine achievement of disabilities, and I want to live in a world where a 11 percent school kid in Melbourne is not a little bit surprised that his new teacher is a <unk> user user user <unk>
The disability doesn't make us <unk> but questioning what you think you know about what you do.
Thank you.
What do you have to see the augmented reality and the professional football with <unk>
And what is the average speed of a <unk> <unk>
Unfortunately, today just answering one of those questions, so please, not <unk>
When people think actually <unk> think of <unk> <unk> and Tom <unk> <unk> the hands in the air, but <unk> reality is not science fiction.
<unk> reality is something that will happen in our days and will happen because we have the tools for it, and people need to know that, because reality is augmented to change our lives as much as the Internet and mobile phones.
So how did we get to reality <unk>
The first step, is what I wear <unk> Google <unk>
I'm sure many people are familiar with them.
What you may not know is that Google <unk> are a device that lets you see what I see.
It will allow you to experience what is a professional <unk> in the field.
Right now, the only way to be in the field is that I try to do it.
I have to use words.
I have to create a framework that you would engage with your imagination.
We can use Google Glass, under a helmet and know what is running through the game of play to 160 <unk> the blood hitting the ears.
We can know that it feels like a 110 year-old man -- we were going to get to you trying to do it with all of your self.
I've been there and I assure you it's not nice.
I would have some videos to show you what this is to use Google <unk> under the shell, and give you an idea of that.
Unfortunately, it's not the images of the <unk> because the idea of the emerging technology is a submarine going up to the surface. But we do what we can.
So let's look at a video.
Chris <unk> Come on.
It's horrible to be <unk>
A little bit.
<unk>
Go!
Chris <unk> As you can see, it's a <unk> of what is being <unk> in the football field, from the perspective of the <unk>
You'll have noticed that lack of people, the rest of the team.
We have a video of them <unk> from the University of Washington.
<unk> <unk> mice. mice.
Blue eight, Blue <unk> Go!
Chris <unk> This is a little bit more like being in the field, but it has nothing to do with the <unk>
<unk> want that experience.
<unk> want to be in the field, will be their favorite players and asked me to YouTube and in <unk> <unk> you can see from the angle of a <unk> <unk>
or a <unk>
We want to experience that."
Once we have that experience with <unk> and Google Glass, how do we go from <unk> how we get it to the next <unk>
We took it to that level using something called <unk> <unk> that you probably know many of you.
<unk> <unk> has been described as the most realistic reality device ever created, and it's not cheap <unk>
And I'm going to show you why why, with this video.
Man: Oh, etc.
No, no, no, no, I don't want to follow <unk> No!
Oh, my God, Ah!
<unk> That's the experience of a man on a Russian mountain, <unk> for his life.
What will be the experience of a fan when we <unk> a video of Adrian Adrian across the line, <unk> from a <unk> with the arm before they run and make a <unk> What will be a fan of a fan of a fan of a fan of it.
And when I can be able to be <unk> running by the <unk> throwing the ball on the bottom of the network?
What will be your experience when you <unk> from a mountain to more than 100 miles an <unk> <unk>
Maybe the sales of <unk> <unk>
But this is not actually <unk>
It's just virtual reality, <unk>
How do we get to <unk> <unk>
<unk> augmented reality when the <unk> <unk> and owners see the information that people want to see and think, "How do we use this to improve our <unk>
How do we use it to win <unk>
Because they always use the technology to win.
They like to win. They give them money.
So here is a short scan of technology in the <unk>
In <unk> the <unk> of Baltimore had a <unk> to their field <unk> to play faster.
They won the Super Bowl that year.
Other teams decided to <unk>
More people saw the party because it was more exciting, faster.
In 1994, the <unk> actually put radii in the <unk> <unk> and then in the <unk>
They got more viewers because it was faster, more fun.
In <unk> imagine that you're a player going back to your group and you see their next country shown in front of you, in a plastic bombsight that you have <unk> you don't have to worry about forget a <unk>
Or by memorize the strategy.
They just go into the field and <unk>
And the coaches want it because they don't follow their instructions, they lose parties, and they hate to lose <unk>
If you lose parties <unk> you would have a coach.
And they don't want that.
But <unk> reality is not just a manual of <unk> strategies.
<unk> reality is also a way to collect information and use it in real time to improve the game.
So how do you do that?
Well, a very simple choice would be to have a camera in every corner of the stadium having a view from the high of the people who are down.
You also get information from the <unk> sensors and <unk> something that's already working on.
And all that information, you send it to your <unk>
The good teams will know <unk>
The bad information will have <unk>
This is going to make good teams of bad equipment.
So your team of computer is going to be as important as your <unk> and the data analysis to stop being just by morality.
It's also going to be <unk> Who would have <unk>
How would it be in the <unk>
Imagine it's the <unk>
Let's take the ball and <unk>
We had an open receptor -- all of a sudden, a <unk> on the left of your Norden bombsight -- you would tell you that a defense behind you are going to <unk> Normally, you don't understand it, but the system of <unk> would you.
<unk> the protection.
Another <unk> <unk> you have a open receptor of it.
<unk> <unk> but <unk>
And the ball loses the trajectory.
You don't know where to land. However, the receptor sees in its bombsight an area of grass that lights up and can modify the career.
It <unk> <unk> <unk> runs and <unk>
The crazy public and the fans have been tracking it from every angle.
This is something to create massive emotion in the game.
I'm going to make lots of people see it, because people want to live that experience.
<unk> want to be in the country.
They want to be your favorite player.
<unk> reality will be part of sports because it's too profitable to be.
But what I ask you is, we want this to be the only use of reality <unk>
We're going to use it just as bread and <unk> like our <unk> entertainment.
Because I think we can use it for something else.
I think we can use augmented reality to foster empathy between human beings, to show someone what it is literally to be in the other person's place.
We know what this technology is worth <unk>
It generates billions of income a year.
But how much is this technology worth for a teacher in the classroom trying to show a <unk> how bad their actions are from the perspective of <unk>
How much is this technology worth for a gay in Uganda or Russia trying to show the world how you live to be <unk>
How much is it true for a <unk> <unk> or a Neil <unk> <unk> trying to inspire a generation of children to think more about space and science instead of <unk> and <unk>
Ladies and gentlemen, the augmented reality gets close.
The questions we do, the decisions we take and the challenges we face, as always, of us.
Thank you.
I was given to me after 23 years of service in the <unk> <unk> of California.
The majority of those 23 years to me -- the country <unk> the south of the County, County <unk> that includes the Golden Golden <unk>
The bridge is a <unk> structure, which is known for its beautiful views of San Francisco, the Pacific Ocean and its inspiring architectural <unk>
Unfortunately, it's also a magnet for suicide, being one of the most used places in the world.
The Golden Gate Bridge was open in <unk>
Joseph <unk> engineer who build the bridge, said that, "The bridge is pretty much <unk>
suicide from the bridge is not practical and <unk>
But from its openness, more of 1,600 people have jumped from their death from that bridge.
Some people believe that traveling between the two towers will take you to another dimension, this bridge has been <unk> as such, so that every single one of it releases you from all your concerns and pain, and the waters that pass under <unk> your soul.
But let me tell you that happens when the bridge is used to commit suicide.
After one every free four to five seconds, the body hits the water about 120 miles an hour.
The impact breaks bone, some of which are very vital organs.
Most of them die in impact.
The people who don't usually get into the <unk> water, and then they <unk>
I don't think that the ones that we <unk> this method of suicide will be aware of the death <unk>
This is the wire.
Except about the two towers, there's 32 inches of parallel steel to the bridge.
This is where most people have been before you get to your life.
I can tell you about experience that once the person is on that edge, and in the darker time, it's very hard to bring them back.
I took this picture last year as this young man talked about with an officer contemplating his life.
I want to tell you that we had success that day in bringing it back to the <unk>
When I started working on the bridge, we didn't have any formal training.
It would be in order to channel the way through these calls.
This was not just a bad service for those of us who were going through the suicide, but the officials as well.
We've come a long way since then.
Today, officials and psychologists train the new official Americans.
This is Jason <unk>
I met him the 22 of Julius last year by getting a call from a possible suicide subject sitting at the <unk> near the center.
<unk> and when I got here, I watched Jason talking with an officer of the Golden Rule.
Jason was 32 years old, and he had flown all from New Jersey.
In fact, he had flown up here twice before New Jersey to try to suicide from this bridge.
After about an hour talking to <unk> we asked if we knew the story of the box of <unk>
<unk> the mythology <unk> <unk> created <unk> and he sent it to the Earth with a box, and he said, "You know, <unk> never open that <unk>
Well, one day, curiosity could be more than <unk> and she opened the box.
From her <unk> <unk> and all kinds of <unk> against man.
The only good thing in the box was hope.
So Jason asked us, "What happens if you open the box and there's no <unk>
A few <unk> he leaned on the right, and he was gone.
This guy, and smart guy in New Jersey just had to take away the life.
I talked to the parents of Jason that night, and I guess when I was talking to them, it didn't seem to be ringing very well, because the next day, the rabbi of the family called me to see how I was.
The parents of Jason had the order.
<unk> damage about suicide affecting a lot of people.
I ask you these questions: What would you do if a member of your family, a friend or someone loved <unk>
What do you do?
So what do we say?
In my experience, you don't just have to talk, but you have to listen.
Listening to understand.
Don't <unk> <unk> or tell the person you know what it feels like, because you probably don't know it.
Just being there, you can be the <unk> point that you need.
If you think someone is <unk> you're not afraid of <unk> and ask the question.
One way to ask you the question is, you know, in similar circumstances have thought about ending your life, you've had these <unk>
<unk> the person in front of you can save life and be the point to <unk> for them.
Other signs to <unk> despair, believe that things are terrible and they never go to <unk> <unk> believe there is nothing you can do to <unk> social isolation and a lost social interest in life.
I came up with this talk just a couple of days, and I got an email from a lady and I'd like to read you his letter.
She lost his son on the 19 of January of this year, and he wrote this email just a couple of days, and it's with her permission and blessing that I read it.
"Hello, <unk> I imagine you're at the TED conference.
It should be a whole experience to be there.
I'm thinking that I should go to the bridge this weekend.
I just wanted to leave you a note.
I hope you can tell a lot of people and go home talking about it to your friends telling your friends, etc.
I'm still quite <unk> but to see the more moments of realizing that Mike won't go home.
Mike was driving from <unk> to San Francisco to see the <unk> party.
He never got there.
I called the police of <unk> and <unk> as the disappeared as the disappeared of the night.
The next morning, two officers came to my house and reported that the Mike <unk> was down in the bridge.
A witness had seen him jump from the bridge to the <unk> of the evening of the day.
Thank you very much for fighting for those who can be temporarily too weak to fight for themselves.
Who has not been wrong before without suffering a real mental illness.
It shouldn't be so easy to end up with it.
My sentences is with you for your struggle.
The <unk> the Golden Golden <unk> is supposed to be a passage through our beautiful <unk> not a <unk>
Good luck this week, <unk>
I can't imagine the value that she needed to go to the bridge and go through the way his son took that day, and also the value to go forward.
I'd like to introduce you to a man that I mean with hope and value.
On March 11, 2005, I wrote to a radio call by a possible suicide bomber on the sidewalk <unk> near the north.
I was able to <unk> on the sidewalk and watched this man, Kevin <unk> standing on the sidewalk.
When I saw me, he crossed the <unk> and stopped in that little tube going around the tower.
Over the time and a half later, I heard like Kevin spoke about his depression and <unk>
Kevin decided to see that day back on that lane and give the life another chance.
When Kevin came up with it.
"This is a new beginning, a new life."
But I asked him, "What was what he did and gave him the hope and gave him the hope and the other one.
And you know what he told me.
He said, "I <unk>
I stopped talking and simply <unk>
Shortly after that incident, I got a letter from the mother of Kevin -- and I have that letter with me, and I would like to give it to you.
"Dear Mr. <unk> Nothing erase the <unk> events and you're one of the reasons that Kevin keeps us with us.
Honestly, I think Kevin was <unk> for help.
It's been diagnosed with a mental illness for which it's been properly <unk>
<unk> to Kevin when I was only six months -- completely unconscious from all those traits -- but thank God, we now know.
Kevin is in order, as the says.
We thank God for you.
I didn't really do debt with you, <unk> <unk>
And at the end of it, she <unk> <unk> When I visited General San Francisco Hospital.
<unk> I did have to do it.
Today, Kevin is a <unk> father and an active member of society.
Talk openly about the events of that day and their depression with the hope that his story inspire others.
<unk> is not just something I've found myself in the work.
It's personal.
My grandfather got <unk> with poison.
And that act, despite the end of his own pain, theft, the chance to meet him.
This is what suicide.
For most people who are <unk> or those who consider the suicide, they wouldn't think of hurt another person.
They just want your own pain.
Usually this is achieved just three things: to sleep, drugs or alcohol or death.
In my career, I've responded and I've been involved in hundreds of mental illness and call calls around the bridge.
Of those incidents that I've been directly involved with, I've only lost two, but those two are too much.
One was <unk>
The other one was a man who talked about about an hour.
And during that time, I was getting my hand at three times.
On the end, I looked at me, and he said, <unk> I'm sorry, but I have to go."
And <unk>
<unk> absolutely nasty.
I want to tell you, though, that the vast majority of the people that we get to contact in that bridge is not <unk>
Also, those few people who have jumped from the bridge and lived and they can talk about it, that one percent or two, most of those people have said that the second one they leave side the railing realized they made a mistake and they wanted to live.
I tell people, the bridge is not only connected to San Francisco, but also to people.
That connection, or the bridge we do, is something that everyone and each of us must be used to do.
suicide can be prevent.
There's help. There's hope.
Thank you very much.
The world makes you be what you don't are, but you know what you are, and a question: How do you get to that?
I need to be something unique in that sense, but I'm not alone, in any way I'm alone.
When I became a model I felt that I had finally achieved the dream that had ever been from a child.
My outside would finally go through my inner self, with my inner me.
For very complicated reasons, which I go over later later, when I look at this picture, I think we managed to get it up to <unk> <unk>
But last October, I discovered that, I found that I'm very early on.
We were all <unk> our families, our religion, our society, our moment in history, even our bodies.
Some people have the <unk> value to get rid of the limitations of the skin of the skin or the beliefs of those who surround us.
These are people who are always challenging the status quo who is considered <unk>
In my case, the last nine years, many of my neighbors, many of my friends, my even, ignored my story.
I think this mystery is called an epiphany.
This is mine.
They recorded me as a <unk> at birth because of the appearance of my <unk>
I remember my five years in the Philippines, in my house, I was always wearing this shirt in his head.
And my mom said, "Why do you always take that shirt in the <unk>
I said, "Mom, that's my hair. I'm a <unk>
I knew then how to <unk>
gender always has been considered a <unk> but now we know that, actually, it's more complex and mystery now.
Because of my success, I will never tell me to share my story, not because it thought to be what I'm bad, but why the world comes to those of us who want to be <unk>
Every day I thank you to be a woman.
I have mom and dad and a family who embrace me like am.
Many are not so lucky.
There's a long tradition in the <unk> culture that celebrates the mystery of gender.
There's a Buddhist <unk> of compassion.
There's a <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
And when I was eight years old, I was at a party in the Philippines who celebrated these puzzles.
I was in front of the stage and I remember that this beautiful woman came up to me, and I remember that moment as if something happened to me, this is the kind of woman I would like to be.
And when I was 15 years old, when I still wore man, I met this woman called <unk>
It's the head of a beauty competition.
That night she asked me, "Why haven't you been involved in the <unk> competition.
He told me that if I <unk> she was responsible for <unk> and <unk> and that night, I won in <unk> I won in <unk> I won in <unk> and he was left in the third <unk> among more than 40 candidate Chicago.
That moment changed my life.
Suddenly, I was inside the world of beauty.
Not a lot of people can say that their first job was from the beauty of women, but I can.
I also met the <unk> <unk> especially when I was <unk> in remote provinces of the Philippines.
But more importantly, I met my best friends in that community.
In 2001 my mom.
I was <unk>
I told my mother, "Mommy, I'm <unk>
I'm here with friends, I like to travel and be a queen of <unk>
But then, two weeks later, he called me and said, "You know if you get to the United States, you can change the name and the identity of <unk>
It was all I needed to hear.
My mom suggested I would put two <unk> to my name.
She also accompanied me when I was <unk> in Thailand to the 19 years.
It's curious that in some of the most rural cities in Thailand perform the most sophisticated surgeries and secure.
And then in the U.S., it was necessary to be done before the name of the name and gender.
So in 2001 I went to San Francisco, and I remember looking at the driving license with the name of the name of the name of the <unk>
It was a great moment.
For some people, your identity document means power to drive or be able to get a <unk> but for me it was the license to live, to feel <unk>
Suddenly, my fears looked at it.
I felt I could conquer my dream and move to New York, and to be model.
Many are not so lucky.
I think of this woman from <unk> <unk> <unk>
A young woman in New York who was <unk> he lived his truth, but he was able to put her life alive.
For many of my community, that's the reality that they live.
Our suicide rates are eight times higher than the rest of the population.
All 20 of November, we make a global waking <unk> by the <unk> Day.
I'm on this stage because of a long history of people who were <unk> and stood in the face of injustice.
These are homosexuality. P. Johnson and Sylvia <unk>
Today, right now, I'm coming out of the closet.
I can't keep living my truth alone and just for me.
I want to do the best to help others live their truth without shame, nor fear.
I'm here, <unk> so that someday there is no more <unk> than 20 of <unk>
My deepest truth led me to accept what I am.
Will you do?
Thank you very much.
Thank you, thank you, thank you.  <unk> <unk> <unk> a quick question.
<unk> <unk> Yeah. <unk> first, thank you all my <unk>
My support network, my parents especially, to my family, which I know is very strong.
I remember all the times I've been to young women who have been <unk> and a few times when they were called me and told me that their parents couldn't take it, I would take my mom and he would say, "Mom, you can call this <unk>
Sometimes it worked, but it's not just identity identity -- that's what's at the center of what we are, right?
I mean, all of us were assigned a gender at birth, and what I try to do is put on the table the subject that sometimes it doesn't block, and there should be a space that would allow people to say, and this is a conversation that we should have with parents, with colleagues.
The <unk> movement is <unk> compared to the gay movement.
There's still a lot of work to do.
There should have understanding.
There should be space for curiosity and to ask questions, and I hope that all of you are my allies.
KS: Thank you. Very polite <unk> Thank you.
In many <unk> societies and tribal societies, they usually know about their children, but I'm one of the few parents who are known for his daughter and I'm proud of it.
<unk> started his campaign by education defending his rights in 2007. And when his efforts was <unk> his efforts in 2011, to the <unk> the <unk> National <unk> made a very popular girl in his country.
Before that, I was my daughter, but now I'm his father.
Ladies and gentlemen, if you look at the history of humanity, the story of women is the story of the <unk> of inequality, of violence and exploitation.
You see, in <unk> societies right from the beginning, when at birth a child, their birth is not <unk>
It's not Nollywood, not by his father, not by his mother.
The neighborhood comes back, day its <unk> to the mother and no one <unk> the father.
And a mother would be excited about having a child.
When it gives birth to the first child, the first daughter, gets sad.
When it gives birth to the second daughter, <unk> and, with the hope of a child, when he was <unk> his third daughter, feels guilty like a criminal.
Not just the mother of mother, but the daughter. The newborn daughter when it's grown up, suffers too.
At the age of five years, when I should go to school, you get home and school faces to her siblings.
Even the age of 12 years in a way, has a good life.
It can be <unk>
You can play with your friends on the street, and you can move through the streets as a butterfly.
But when you go into your adolescence, when it gets 13 years old, you have to leave her house without a male <unk>
It's confined to the four walls of their house.
It's no longer a free person.
It becomes the honor of his father and his father and his family, and if they were to <unk> the code of that of it, would honor even kill.
And it's interesting that this animal code, it doesn't only affect the life of a <unk> it also affects the life of male members of the family.
So this brother, <unk> the joys of his life and the happiness of his sisters in the name of the course of honor.
And there's a rule more of <unk> societies called <unk>
It's supposed to be a good girl who has to be very expensive, very humble and very <unk>
It's the judgment.
The model of a good girl should be <unk>
It's supposed to be silent and they support people's decisions and her mother and the decisions of the <unk> even if they don't will.
If you put it with a man who doesn't like or if you had a <unk> with an old man, you have to <unk> because you don't want to be <unk>
If the <unk> very young, it has to take it.
Otherwise, the <unk> <unk>
And what happens to the end?
In the words of a <unk> "The <unk> and then gives birth to more children and <unk>
And the irony of the situation is that this mother, <unk> the same lesson of <unk> to his daughter and the same lesson for her children.
And this vicious circle goes on and it continues.
<unk> brothers and sisters, when I was born, and for the first time, believe me, I don't like my newborns, to be honest, but when I was there and I looked at his eyes, believe me, I felt incredibly <unk>
And so long before I was <unk> I thought about his name, and I was fascinated with a <unk> <unk> of freedom in Afghanistan.
His name was <unk> <unk> and I called my daughter like this for her.
But when I was <unk> they were all men, and I grabbed my pen, and I took a line of my name, and I wrote, <unk>
And when she grew, when I was four and a half years ago, I was playing it in my school.
You might wonder, why should I mention a little girl in a school?
Yeah, I have to <unk>
You can give it for granted in Canada, in the United States, in many developed countries, but in the poor countries, in the industrialized societies in the tribal societies, it's a great event for a young girl.
<unk> in a school means the recognition of his identity and his name.
One thanks to the school means it's in the world of the dreams and the aspirations where it can explore its potential for their future life.
I have five sisters, and none of them could go to school, and they would be <unk> two weeks earlier, when I was going to take a <unk> form and I was at the relative part of the family, and I couldn't remember the <unk> of some of my sisters.
And the reason I had never seen my own names of my sisters written in any document.
That was the reason for my daughter.
What my father couldn't give my sisters and his daughters, and I thought I had to change it.
I used to appreciate the intelligence and the <unk> of my daughter.
I got to sit with me when my friends came to me.
The encouraged to go with me to different meetings.
And all of these values, I've tried to hold it into their personality.
And this wasn't just for her, just for <unk>
I have <unk> all these good values in my school to girls and boys in the same way.
I used education for <unk>
<unk> my daughters, taught students, to forget the lesson of <unk>
I taught students to forget the lesson of the so-called <unk>
<unk> brothers and sisters, <unk> for more rights for women, and <unk> to have more and more space for women in society.
But we find a new phenomenon.
It was lethal for human rights and in particular, for women's rights.
It was called <unk>
That means a complete denial of women's participation in all of the political and social activities.
Hundreds of schools were lost.
The girls are banned to go to school.
Women were forced to use <unk> and they stopped going to the markets.
The musicians were <unk> the <unk> girls and the singers were killed.
<unk> millions, but a few <unk> and it was terrifying to have around those people who kill and <unk> when you're talking about their rights.
It's really frightening.
At the age of 10 years, he got up and got up by the right to education.
He wrote a newspaper for the CEO of BBC, offered her to the New York Times, and he talked to every platform that he could.
And his voice was the most powerful voice.
It <unk> like a <unk> around the world.
And that was the reason the Taliban couldn't tolerate his campaign and October October 2012, he was shot in the head.
It was one day <unk> for my family and me.
The world became a great black hole.
While my daughter was <unk> between life and death, I read my wife to my wife and "I've got to <unk> for what happened to my daughter, <unk>
And <unk> said, "Please, don't you <unk>
<unk> the fair cause.
<unk> your life in play by the cause of truth, because of the cause of peace, and because of the cause of education, and your daughter was inspired by you and you get <unk>
Both were on the right path and God <unk>
So these few words I would have a lot of a lot for me, and I didn't get back to ask again.
When I was <unk> I was in the hospital and I had severe headaches and strong headaches because his facial nerve was cut down, I used to see a dark shadow that <unk> on the face of my wife.
But my daughter is never <unk>
I used to say, "I'm okay with my <unk> smile with my face.
I'm going to put it right. Please don't get away.
It was a comfort for us, and we <unk>
<unk> brothers and sisters, have learned from her how to resist the hardest moments and I'm pleased to share with you that despite being an icon for the rights of children and women, it's like any <unk> girl and women, it's like any <unk> girl.
<unk> when he doesn't just get his task.
They fight his brothers, and I'm very happy for that.
People ask me, "What about special in my <unk> who has made so bold to <unk> so courageous and <unk> and <unk>
I say, don't ask me what I did.
<unk> what I didn't.
It didn't cut its wings and that's everything.
Thank you very much.
Thank you. Thank you very much. Thank you.
I was <unk> of the brain 18 years ago, and since that day, the science of the brain has become a personal passion.
I'm engineering.
And I want to tell you that recently I've joined the Google group of Google, where I've had a <unk> to my <unk> <unk> <unk> But all the work that I talk today about today about the science of the brain, I did before I join Google or outside my work there.
Having said that, there's a stigma when you get to a brain operation,
You're still the same as smart or not?
It's not going to be so likely to be <unk>
After the <unk> I was missing a part of the brain, and I had to live with it.
It wasn't gray, but it was the dead part of the center that creates important hormones and <unk>
Immediately after the operation, I had to decide how much to take, more than a dozen powerful chemicals every day, because if I didn't take anything to die in a few hours.
Every day, for the last 18 years, I've had to decide about the combinations and mix them out of chemicals, and try to get them back to life.
Over once I've saved I've saved me.
But luckily, I have a soul of <unk> so I decided I was going to try to get the <unk> dose, because there really doesn't have a clear map that I say in <unk>
I started trying to try different mixes -- and I was surprised to see how small changes in the doses I was going to dramatically see my <unk> my sense of who I was, my way to think, my behavior with others.
A particularly <unk> case for a few months, I tried a dose, and a typical chemicals for a middle-aged man, and I was surprised to see how I would look at my thoughts.
I was always <unk> I thought all the time in sex, and I thought it was the smartest person around the world, and --  of course, many times in the past I've met several kinds of guys like this, or perhaps some versions of it.
It turned out as a extreme.
But my great surprise was that I wasn't trying to be <unk>
In fact, I was <unk> a little bit <unk> to fix a problem that I had in front of it, and it just won't happen.
So I couldn't handle it.
I changed my <unk>
But I think that that experience gave me a new appreciation about men and what they have to do -- since then I have better with the men.
What I was trying to do with those hormones and neurotransmitters and so on, was to reclaim my intelligence after the disease and the <unk> my creative thought, my flow of ideas.
<unk> thinking almost always in pictures, and that became my key point of reference to how to do those mental images that I use to create <unk> my ideas, if you were <unk> new ideas and <unk>
This kind of thoughts is not new.
<unk> like <unk> Descartes and <unk> look at things like this.
They thought the images and mental ideas were the same thing.
There are people who challenge this idea, and there are a lot of arguments about how the mind works, for me is simple: to most of us, mental images are fundamental for thinking and <unk> thinking.
So after several years, I found the point right now, and I have already lots of great mental <unk> actually <unk> very sophisticated and <unk>
Now, I'm working on how to take these rapid mental images from my mind to the computer screen.
Can you imagine what would happen if a film director was able to use its imagination just to drive the world that has the <unk>
Or if a musician could extract the music of his mind?
There are incredible possibilities with this, as the way people creative can get to share the speed of light.
And the truth is, the only difficulty to achieve this is simply increase the resolution of our brain scanning systems.
Let me show you why I think we're pretty close to coming to this with two recent experiments that were made by two groups going on in neuroscience.
They both used MRI technology, an MRI MRI picture, to represent the brain here, and you can see the brain scan done by <unk> <unk> and his colleagues at Harvard.
The column on the left shows the scan of the brain of a person who looks at an image.
The middle column shows the scanning of the brain scan of that same individual as you were looking at it, looking at that same image.
The column on the right was created -- the content of the central column on the left -- you see that the difference is almost strong.
This is <unk> in many different individuals with many different images, always with a similar outcome.
The difference between looking at an image and imagine seeing that same picture is almost strong.
Now, let me share with you another experiment. This is from the Jack <unk> lab in Berkeley, California.
They managed to convert brain waves in visual <unk>
Let's put it in this way.
In this experiment, I showed people hundreds of hours of YouTube videos while they were taking their brains to create a great pool of brain reactions in the brain sequences.
And then I showed you a film with new images, new people, new animals, and while they were so <unk> a new <unk>
The computer using just the brain information from scanning the scan of <unk> to show what it seemed like the person was seeing.
On the right you can see the <unk> of the computer, and on the left, the video I showed you.
This left us <unk>
We're right about doing it.
We just need to improve the resolution.
And now, remember, when you see a picture and when you imagine that same image, it is created in the brain the same <unk>
This led to the brain scanning brain systems that are available today, and their resolution increased as a thousand times in the last years.
Now we need to increase the resolution about a thousand times more to get a deeper look.
How do we <unk>
There are many techniques to do it.
One is opening up the skull and put it.
I don't offer me for that.
Many are proposing new techniques of projection by images, even me, <unk> with the recent outcome of the MRI -- first we have to ask what this is, this technology will be the end of the road.
The conventional wisdom says that the only way to get greater resolution is with larger magnets -- but to this point, magnets is more <unk> only give little improvements in the resolution, not increases by thousands as we need.
I propose this idea: rather than larger magnets make better magnets better.
We can create a much more complex structures with slightly different structures, like making a <unk>
And why does this matter?
In the last few years, a lot of effort in MRI is to make it really big, right?
However, most of the recent advances in <unk> of clever solutions and brilliant solutions in jeans and <unk> in the villagers, and receptors in FM systems.
In turn, instead of a magnetic field -- they would have <unk> magnetic patterns.
So when we combine the magnetic patterns with the patterns of the radio processing frequencies we can increase the information that you can extract in a single <unk>
In addition, we can then split up in layers our growing knowledge on the structure of the brain and memory to create the increase in the thousands we need.
By using the <unk> we should be able to measure not just the blood fluid <unk> but the hormones and <unk> that I mentioned and perhaps even direct neural activity -- this is the dream.
Will we be able to put our ideas in a direct way to digital media.
Can you imagine if we could go through the language and communicate directly through the <unk>
What would we be <unk>
And how are we going to learn to deal with the truths of human thinking.
You thought the Internet is a big thing.
These are great questions.
It would be advocating as a tool to amplify our thinking skills and communication.
Certainly, this same tool could take the cure for Alzheimer's and similar disease.
We have a few more choices to open up this door.
Anyway, pick one year, will happen in five or 15 years?
It's hard to imagine it will take much more.
We need to learn how to take this step together.
Thank you.
I'll talk to you tonight about getting out of the closet, and not in a traditional sense, not just the gay closet.
I think we all have <unk>
Her behavior is probably saying to some person for the first time you love, or tell someone who's pregnant, or tell someone who has cancer, or any other hard conversation for which you have through your life.
It was all a really difficult conversation, and even though our issues can vary <unk> the experience of I've lived and have come out of that curriculum is something universal.
It's fear, and we don't like it, and it must happen.
A lot of years ago, I was working in the South Side of the South Side of a restaurant in the city, and being there, I had to go through several stages of the intensity of <unk> <unk> <unk> -- I didn't understand my armpits, to quote <unk> as a <unk>
And I'm going to be slope that by the <unk> of my short pants and because I had my head -- I would ask a little bit of a child -- "Hey, you're a kid or <unk>
And it would appear a awkward silence on the table.
<unk> my jaw a little bit more, and I would take my coffee with a <unk>
The father <unk> <unk> the newspaper and the mother threw a cold look at his son.
But I would not say anything, and <unk> on it.
And I came to the point that every time I went to a place where there was a child between three and 10 years, I was ready to fight with.
And that's a terrible feeling.
So I promised myself that next time I would say something.
It would be that hard conversation.
So after a few weeks, it happened.
"You're a guy or a <unk>
A family silence -- but this time I was ready and I was about to get into the female issues on the table.  He had the Betty <unk>
<unk> <unk>
Even a clip of the "Vagina Monologues," I <unk> it out.
So I took it down and I went down and I went down and my backs up a four-year-old girl with a pink dress looking at what is not a challenge for a <unk> <unk> just a little girl with a question: "You're a kid or <unk>
And so I took a lot of it again, and I put it up close to her, and I said, "Hey, I know this is a quick thing.
I have the short hair like the one of a boy, and I have seen clothes, and I am a girl, and you know, as you like to use a pink dress and sometimes you like to use a comfortable <unk>
Now, I'm more of the kind of <unk>
And that girl looked at me <unk> paying attention, and he said, "My favorite favorite is <unk> and it has a fish.
You can give you a <unk> for <unk>
And that was all of it, just "Ah, <unk> you're a girl.
What about the <unk> that <unk>
It was the easiest conversation that I ever had.
And by <unk> Because the girl from the <unk> and I, both were <unk> one with the other.
So as many of us, I've lived in some <unk> in my life, and I know, often, my walls used to be a <unk>
But inside, in the dark, you can't know what the color is.
You just know how it feels like a closet.
This is how my curriculum is not different from yours or anywhere or yours.
<unk> I'm going to give you a hundred reasons why you get out of my closet. It was more difficult than getting out of it, but this is the <unk> it's hard to be <unk>
The hard is hard.
Who can tell me that explaining to somebody who has declared online <unk> is harder than to say it's been <unk>
Who can tell me that this story that I tell is harder than telling your five year-old son that you are going to <unk>
There's no more difficult thing, there's only the hard.
We need to stop farming -- what is difficult to be hard about how hard to make us feel better or worse relative to our <unk> and we need to just feel empathy because we all live something hard.
In some point in our lives, we all live in <unk> and they may feel security, or at least more security than the other side of the door.
But I'm here to tell you that no matter what the walls are made out of the walls, which is not a place to live.
Thank you.  Imagine yourself 20 years ago.
I, I had a horse, a horse and dress and shoes of <unk>
It was not the European <unk> prepared to fight any four years in the coffee.
I was frozen in fear, <unk> in a corner of my dark closet.
My family, my whole friends, strangers who I've spent my entire life trying to not <unk> and now the world was turning around on purpose.
I was burning the pages of a script that we've all been following for so long, but if you don't throw that <unk> you kill you.
One of my most memorable launches was my sister.
It was the first time that many people were invited to know that I was gay, and by doing my <unk> lady in my <unk> black dress and <unk> walked around the tables and finally came to one where the friends of my parents, people who knew me was done to me.
And after I'm talking about a moment, one of the women I said, <unk> Nathan <unk>
And the battle of the gay account had started.
<unk> once you were in the <unk>
"Well, yeah, the truth is that we have friends in San <unk>
"Well, we've never gone there, but we heard it's <unk>
<unk> you know my <unk> <unk>
It's very good and never talked about having <unk>
So what is your favorite TV show.
Our favorite program, Will and Grace and Grace <unk>
And you know who <unk> <unk>
Jack is our <unk>
And then a woman, <unk> but in hopes I'm desperately trying to show her support, to make me know that I was on my side, finally said, "Well, sometimes my husband uses shirt <unk>
And I had an opportunity at that time, like you have all the <unk> <unk>
<unk> could have been easy to tell you where they felt <unk>
It's not very hard to find them and realize the fact that they were <unk>
And what else can you ask for someone, but <unk>
If you're going to be authentic with somebody, you have to be prepared for the authentic thing to do.
It's like the hard conversations are still not going to be my strong point.
Ask for anybody that I have been <unk>
But I'm getting better, and I follow what I like to call the three principles of the <unk>
Now, please look at this through the gay perspective, but you understand that what you need to get out of anything is essentially the same.
Number one: Be real.
<unk> <unk> Be yourself.
That little girl in coffee had no <unk> but I was ready for the battle.
If you want someone to be <unk> the other people must know that we also suffer.
Number two: Be <unk> Just <unk> your <unk>
If you know that they are gay, <unk>
If they say to their parents that maybe they could be gay, they will keep the hope that it could change.
Don't give you a false sense of hope.
And number three, and more important --  Let alone the complex.
You communicate your truth.
It would never be done for that.
And some of them can be injured hurt by sure, <unk> by what they've done, but they never am sorry for what they are.
And yes, maybe some will feel <unk> but that something in them, not in you.
Those are the expectations of what you are, but not your own.
That's the story of them, but not of you.
The only story that matters is what you want to write.
So the next time you find in a dark <unk> <unk> a <unk> must know that we've all been there before.
And you may feel very themselves, but they don't.
Thank you, <unk> Enjoy the <unk>
What is that?
If you look at the story of how the intelligence has been seen -- an productive example has been the famous quote from <unk> <unk> that "The question of whether a machine can think about is as interesting as the question of whether an submarine can <unk>
When <unk> <unk> wrote this as a criticism to computer pioneers like Alan <unk>
And so a few years ago, I would have a program to try to understand the fundamental physical mechanisms of intelligence.
Let's take a step.
First, let's start with a mental experiment.
Imagine that they are from a living race that you don't know anything about the biology of the Earth and the neuroscience of the Earth and the intelligence of the Earth, but you have incredible telescopes and you can see the Earth, and they have incredibly long lives -- so you can see the Earth for millions, even billions of years.
And you see a very strange effect.
Of course, as <unk> we know that the reason is that we're trying to save ourselves.
We're trying to avoid an impact.
But if you're from a alien race that doesn't know anything about this, that it doesn't have any concept on Earth intelligence -- you would forced to develop a physical theory that would explain how, at a certain time in time, the asteroids that are going to take off the surface of a planet <unk> stop doing it.
And so I say this is the same question that understanding the physical nature of intelligence.
So in this program that I conducted a number of years ago, I looked at a variety of issues through science, through various disciplines that I think, to a single underlying mechanism of intelligence.
In <unk> for example, there have been a variety of evidence that our universe seems to be <unk> active for the development of intelligence, and in particular, for the development of universal states that are going to bring the diversity of possible future.
Finally, in the planning of robotic movement, there have been a variety of recent techniques that have tried to harness the skills of robots to maximize the future freedom of action in order to perform complex tasks.
And so taking all of these different issues and <unk> together, and I said, for a number of years ago, there's a underlying mechanism for intelligence that we can extract from all these different <unk>
There's only one equation for <unk>
And I think the answer is yes. What you're seeing is probably the closest equivalent of a E = <unk> for the intelligence I have seen.
So what you're looking at here is a statement that intelligence is a force, wells that acts in order to maximize the future freedom of action.
It acts in order to maximize the future freedom of action, or keeping open options, with a force T, with the diversity of possible future accessible, Yeah, until an impending future time.
In a nutshell, intelligence doesn't like to be <unk>
The intelligence is trying to maximize the future freedom of action and maintaining their options.
And so having to realize this equation, it's natural natural, what can you do with this?
How <unk> it is?
<unk> the human intelligence.
<unk> intelligence <unk>
So I'm going to show you now a video that I think, will show some of the amazing applications of this simple equation.
Narrator: <unk> research in cosmology have suggested that universes that produce more mess, or <unk> during their life should have trend more favorable for the existence of intelligent beings like us.
But what if that <unk> connection.
What if smart behavior is not only dealing with the production of entropy in the long term, but actually comes directly from her?
To find out, we've developed a software engine called <unk> designed to maximize the production of long-term entropy in any system that you can find in.
Amazingly, <unk> could spend multiple animal intelligence, play games, and even making money <unk> actions, all of it without being asked to do that.
Here are some examples of <unk> in action.
Just like a single human standing with no <unk> here we see <unk> <unk> automatically a pole using a <unk>
This behavior is remarkable in part because we never gave them a goal.
He just decided to balance the <unk>
This ability of balance will have applications for <unk> robotics and human care technology.
This ability to use tools will have applications in intelligent manufacturing and agriculture.
Also, just like some other animals can cooperate pulling together on opposite ends of a rope at the same time to release the food, here we see that <unk> can do a version of the model of that task.
This ability of cooperation has interesting consequences for economic planning and in a variety of other fields.
<unk> is widely applicable on a variety of <unk>
For example, here we see successfully playing a game of <unk> against itself, <unk> its potential for play.
So here we see <unk> orchestrate new connections in a social network where your friends are constantly <unk> and it keeps success the net well.
This same network <unk> capacity also has applications in health care, in energy and intelligence.
So here we see <unk> organizing the routes of a fleet of boats, discovering with success and using the Panama Canal to expand its reach from the Atlantic to the Pacific.
In the same way, <unk> is widely applicable on defense and logistics and transportation.
Finally, here we see <unk> spontaneously finding out and run a strategy of <unk> <unk> in a range of <unk> negotiation negotiation in a range of negotiating <unk>
This ability of risk management will have vast applications in finance and secure.
Alex <unk> What you've seen is that a variety of intelligent cognitive behaviors, such as the use of tools, walking upright and social cooperation -- all flow of one single equation, which leads to a system to maximize their future freedom of action.
Now, here's a profound <unk>
Let's go back to the beginning of the term robot, the <unk> work -- there was always the concept that if you were <unk> smart machines, there would be a <unk> rebellion that would be <unk>
<unk> <unk> against us.
One of the biggest consequences of this work is that maybe all these decades, we've had the whole concept of rebellion to the reverse.
It's not that the machines first get smart and then <unk> and they try to take over the world.
It's the other thing that the impulse to take control of every future is a more fundamental principle that the intelligence of intelligence, that general intelligence can actually arise directly from taking control rather than being the other way around.
Another important consequence is the search for the target.
I often ask me, "How do you look for goals about this kind of <unk>
My equivalent of that statement to that statement to move to the descendants of the descendants to help them build artificial managers or to help them understand human intelligence, is this: intelligence has to be seen as a physical process that tries to maximize the future freedom of action and avoid the restrictions in their own future.
Thank you very much.
We're at an inflection point in human history, something between the stars and losing the planet we call <unk>
And yet, in the last few years, we've extended our knowledge of how Earth fits into the context of the universe.
The Kepler mission has discovered thousands of possible planets orbiting other stars, what points to the Earth is only one between the billions of planets in our galaxy.
Kepler is a space telescope that measures the faint intensity of stars when the planets go through them, and they block a little bit of that light that we get back.
The data gathered in the Kepler show the sizes of planets in addition to the distance that there are between them and their mother.
And so together, this helps us understand whether these planets are small and <unk> like the Earth planets in our solar system, and also how much light they get from their own power.
In turn, it gives it clues about whether these planets that we find are habitable or not.
Unfortunately, as we are finding out of potentially <unk> worlds -- our own planet is <unk> under the weight of humanity.
<unk> was the <unk> <unk>
<unk> and sea ice that has been with us for us for millennia, now they're disappearing in a matter of decades.
These environmental changes that have caused a global scale -- have <unk> our ability to alter their course.
But I'm not a <unk> climate or <unk>
I study the <unk> planet influenced by the stars, the hope of finding places in the universe where to discover life beyond our planet.
You might say I'm looking for alien opportunities in the property sector.
Now, as someone very interested in the search for life in the universe can tell you that the more I look for planets like the Earth, more enjoy our own planet.
Each of these new worlds invites a comparison between the newly discovered planet and planets that we know -- our solar system.
Let's take our neighbor, Mars.
Mars is small and <unk> and despite being a little bit further from the Sun, it can be considered a potentially livable world demonstrated this for a mission like the <unk>
In fact, it's possible that Mars has been livable in the past, and in part, that's why we study both Mars.
Our <unk> like the <unk> are tracking their surface in search of clues about the origins of life as we know it.
The satellites that <unk> like the <unk> mission take samples from the <unk> atmosphere, and try to understand how Mars has been able to lose their <unk>
The private companies now offer not only short space flights but also the possibility of living on Mars.
But even though all of these images are <unk> we remind us the deserts of our planet, places that are linked in our imagination with ideas and <unk> and compared to the Earth, Mars is a pretty terrible place to live.
Let's take the extension of the <unk> areas of our planet that are still <unk> places, compared to Mars.
Even in the most dry and higher places on Earth, air is cool and filled with oxygen <unk> by our tropical forests thousands of miles away.
I worry that this excitement on Mars on Mars and other planets will be able to get a big and sad <unk> the implication and the belief of some that Mars would expect to save this <unk> <unk> of the only planet that we know that is truly livable the Earth.
For a lot that I like <unk> exploration, I'm deep disagree with this idea.
There are a lot of good reasons to go to Mars, but say that Mars will be there to <unk> humanity is like imagine that the captain of Titanic is going to talk to the party that actually will have place later on the <unk> <unk>   Thank you.
But the goals for <unk> exploration, and the land preservation is not <unk>
No, they're actually faces of the same <unk> the goal of understanding, preserve and improve life in the future.
The extreme environments in our world look like <unk> aliens.
They are only closer to home.
If we can understand how to create and keep gaps in the hostile and <unk> areas of the ground, maybe we could meet the need to preserve our environment and go beyond that.
Let me leave you with an experiment <unk> the paradox of <unk>
A lot of years ago, the physicist Enrico Fermi asked me to realize that our universe has been around for a long time, and we hope that there were many planets in this universe, we should have found evidence for the existence of alien life until now.
Well, where are they?
Well, a possible solution to the paradox paradox is that when civilizations become very advanced enough to consider living among the stars, they lose the notion of how important the planets are to protect the origin of the planets that are going to develop this development.
It's <unk> to think that it's only going to be able to save us from ourselves, but it is the planetary preservation and <unk> exploration, can work together.
If we really believe in our ability to look at the hostile environments of Mars for human presence -- then we should be able to overcome the task even easier to preserve <unk> on Earth.
Thank you.
A few years ago, I would take my own house.
And as I was on the front porch looking at my pockets, I realized I didn't have the keys.
In fact, I could see the window that they were on the dining table where there were them <unk>
So quickly I tried to open all the other doors and windows, and they were all very closed.
I thought I'd call a <unk> at least I had my cell phone, but at midnight, a <unk> could take a long time to get there, and it was cold.
I couldn't go back home from my friend in Jeff to spend night because I had an early flight to Europe in the morning, following me from my passport and my bag.
<unk> expensive, but even more expensive than a half late night, so I thought, well, despite the circumstances, I was a good thing in the air.
I'm a profession and I know a little bit about how the brain works under stress.
<unk> <unk> which increases heart rate -- <unk> levels of adrenaline and <unk> the thought.
And when I got to the <unk> counter at the airport, I realized I didn't have my passport.
Well, I had a long time to think about those eight hours without sleep.
And I began to ask myself, if there was something that I could do, that I could put in his place, that I would say bad things.
Or at least, if the bad things happen, you know, the probability of a total catastrophe is going to be.
So I started thinking about that, but until a month later my thoughts don't <unk>
I was having dinner with my colleague Danny <unk> winner of the Nobel Prize, and a little embarrassed I talked about that I broke the window, and that I had forgotten my passport, and Danny shared with me that I'd been practicing something called <unk> <unk>
It's something that he had learned from the psychologist Gary <unk> who had written out of this a few years before, known as the <unk>
Everybody knows what's the <unk>
Every time there is a disaster, a team of experts come and try to figure out what came wrong, right?
In the <unk> as it explains <unk> you look forward and try to find out all the things that could go wrong, then you try to figure out what it can do to prevent things out or to minimize the damage.
So what I want to talk about with you is some things we can do in the form of a <unk>
Some of them are <unk> others are not so evident.
I'm going to start with the obvious thing.
At the house, we would get a place for things that are very easily.
This sounds common and it is, but there's a lot of science that supports this <unk> based on how our space works.
There is a structure in the brain called hippocampus, which has evolved over the course of thousands of years, to make a track of the location of the important things, where the fish are, where the fish are, where the fish live, where they live tribes and <unk>
The hippocampus is the part of the brain that was <unk> in the <unk> of London.
It's the part of the brain that allows the <unk> to find their nuts.
And if you ask if someone really did the experiment, they cut the <unk> sense of the <unk> and they still could find their nuts.
They didn't use smell, but the hippocampus, that very evolved mechanism in the brain to find things.
But it's really good for things that don't move a lot, not so good for things that move a lot.
This is the reason for losing your car keys and <unk> and <unk>
So at home I had a place for the keys, a hook to the door, maybe a <unk> dish.
For your passport, a particular drawer in the end.
For your reading, a particular <unk>
If you go to a place and you're <unk> your things will always be there when the <unk>
What about <unk>
Take the cell phone a picture of your credit card license to drive, British <unk> by mail for themselves to be in the cloud.
If these things lose or <unk> this can facilitate the <unk>
These are some of the most obvious things.
Remember, when you are under stress, your brain releases understandable.
<unk> is toxic and <unk> thought.
So part of the <unk> practice is to recognize that under stress we will not be at the best time, and we have to put the systems on their site.
And there's perhaps no more stressful situation than when you face a medical decision.
And at some point, we will all be in that situation, to have to make a very important decision about the future of our medical care future or a dear to help them with a decision.
And so I want to talk about that.
And I'll talk about a very particular medical condition.
But this is <unk> as a <unk> for all decision-making decisions, and actually to make financial decisions and social decisions, any kind of decision that you have to benefit from an rational assessment of the facts.
So suppose they go to the doctor and the doctor says, "I received the result of the lab and cholesterol is a little bit <unk>
Everybody knows that high cholesterol is associated with a greater risk of heart disease, heart attack, <unk>
So you're thinking that having high cholesterol is not the best, then the doctor says, "I'd like to give you a drug that will help you reduce the <unk> a <unk>
And maybe you've heard about the <unk> and you know it's one of the most <unk> drugs in the world today, even you are likely to know people who are <unk>
So you think, "Yes, <unk> <unk>
But there's a question that you have to do then, a statistic that you have to ask for the most doctors don't want to talk, and companies even less.
It's for the <unk> the number need to treat.
And what is this, the <unk>
It's the number of people who have to take a drug or submit to surgery in any medical procedure before they help one person.
And you must think of what kind of <unk> statistic is <unk>
The number must be one.
My doctor would not tell me something if it wasn't to help me.
But actually, medical practice doesn't work like this.
And it's not a matter of the doctor, and if it comes to somebody, it's from scientists like me.
We haven't understood the <unk> mechanisms.
But the <unk> estimates that 90 percent of drugs works only 30 to 50 percent of people.
So the number need to treat the most widely <unk> which you think it is?
How many people have to take it before they help a person?
300.
This according to the research of the cynical researchers cynical <unk> and Pamela <unk> <unk> independently <unk>
I would explore the numbers.
300 people have to take the drug for a year before they avoid a single heart attack, stroke or another <unk> event.
Now you might think, "Well, one probability in 300 to go down my <unk>
Why don't you not, <unk> <unk> the recipe for all <unk>
But then you have to ask for one more statistic and it is, <unk> of the <unk> effects.
For this particular drug, the side effects occur in five percent of the patients.
And those include <unk> things and muscle pain and <unk> pain -- but now they're thinking, "What five percent is not very likely to happen to me, still like taking the <unk>
But a moment.
Now remember, under stress don't think they're clearly.
So think about how to do this with the time, so you don't have to make the chain of reasoning in the act.
300 people take the drug, right? A person has <unk> five percent of the 300 have side effects, that's 15 people.
You have 15 times more likely to get out of the drug that can help you for a drug.
I don't say they should or not take the <unk>
I just say you must have this conversation with your doctor.
The medical ethic is, it's part of the beginning of informed consent.
We have to have access to this kind of information to start the conversation about whether you want to take the risks or not.
Now you may be thinking that I've launched this number in the air value for the crash -- but actually this needs to treat is quite typical.
For the surgery that is actually done in the largest men in the top of 50 percent of prostate cancer, the number one needs to deal with is <unk>
This is exactly 30 surgeries for a person who has <unk>
And the side effects in that case are produced in 50 percent of the patients.
Those include <unk> or dysfunction -- <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
And if you're lucky and it's one of that 50 percent of the effects just <unk> a year or two.
So the idea of <unk> is to think before the questions that you can make up with the conversation forward.
You don't have to make all this in the act.
And they also want to think about the quality of life.
Because you have a choice a lot of times, you want a shorter life of pain, or a longer life that could have much pain to the end?
These are the things that they talk about and think about now, with their family and their loved ones.
You can change in the heat of the moment, but at least you're trained in this kind of thought.
Remember, our brain releases <unk> under stress, and one of the things that happens at that moment is that a lot of systems.
There's an evolutionary reason for this.
Face in the face of a predator -- you don't need the <unk> system or the <unk> or the immune system, because if your body is spending metabolism in those things, it's not very quickly. You could get to be the lunch lunch so nothing matters.
Unfortunately, one of the things that goes through the window during those stress moments is rational and rational thinking -- as Danny <unk> and his colleagues have been shown.
So we have to think about it to think about the future to these kinds of situations.
I think the important thing here is to recognize that we are all <unk>
We're all going to fail once in time.
The idea is to think about the future how they could be those <unk> to put systems in the place that will help minimize damage, or to prevent things wrong in the first place.
<unk> the night of snow in <unk> when I came back from my journey, my contractor and I installed a combination of combination with the door, with a key to the entry door to the same, an easy way to remember it.
And I have to admit that I still have lots of cards that I haven't ordered -- and lots of email messages I haven't seen.
So I'm not very organized, but I see the organization as a <unk> process, and I'm doing it.
Thank you very much.
Interpreter: <unk> <unk> is my favorite <unk>
It means playing <unk>
If you're playing a musical instrument and you see a <unk> in the <unk> you need to play more <unk>
Two <unk> even more smooth.
Four <unk> extremely smooth.
This is my drawing of a <unk> tree there, that it doesn't matter how many thousands and thousands of <unk> can be -- you will never go to a complete silence.
That's my current definition of <unk> a very dark sound.
I'd like to share a little bit about the history of the American system of sign -- the <unk> in addition to a little bit of my own story.
The language of French signs came over the decade of 1800, and over the time of time, they mixed with local signs and developed the language that we now know as <unk>
So it has a story about 200 years.
I was born <unk> And I was taught to believe that the sound was not a part of my life.
And I thought it was true.
However, I realize that it's not true for anything.
The sounds are a very important part of my life, really are in my mind every day.
As a <unk> person who lives in a <unk> world is as if I lived in a foreign country, following <unk> their rules, <unk> behaviors and norms without <unk>
So how do I understand the sound like?
Well, I see how people behave and respond to sound.
People are like my little speakers and <unk> the sound.
<unk> and <unk> that behavior.
At the same time, I've learned that I can create sound, and I've seen how people <unk>
So I've learned, for example.
"Not <unk> <unk>
"Don't do a lot of noise to eat the bag of potato <unk>
"Not <unk> and when you're eating, make sure not <unk>
All of this is <unk> <unk>
Maybe I think on the sound label more than the average person does.
I'm super <unk> of sound.
And I'm always waiting for <unk> the sound, which is going to come next.
From there, this drawing.
<unk> by decide.
<unk> for going.
<unk> for <unk>
You can see the <unk> doesn't have notes on the lines.
That's because the lines already contain sounds through the subtle <unk> and <unk>
In <unk> culture, the movement is equivalent to sound.
This is the signal to <unk> in the <unk>
A typical <unk> has five lines.
However, for me, to make it with my thumb -- so it doesn't feel natural.
That's why in my drawings I only have four lines on the paper.
In 2008, I had the opportunity to travel to Berlin, Germany, for an artistic apartment there.
Before this time, I had worked like <unk>
During this summer, I visited museums and spaces of different <unk> and as I went from one place to another, I realized that there was no visual art there.
At that time, the sound was the trend and that called me <unk>
There was no visual art, everything was <unk>
Now the sound has come into my territory of art.
It's going to be more than art?
I realized that it doesn't have to be like this.
In fact, I know the sound.
I know it so well that it's not only experienced through the ears.
I can feel it <unk> or I experience visually, or even as an idea.
So I decided to reclaim the sound of sound and <unk> in my artistic practice.
And all they had taught me in terms of sound, I decided to leave it and <unk>
I began to create a new body of work.
And when I presented it to the artistic community, I was <unk> with the amount of support and attention that I got.
I realized that sound is like money, power -- the <unk> social currency.
In the bottom of my mind, I always felt that the sound was <unk> it was a little <unk>
And the sound is so powerful that I could take care of me and my art work, or I could be able to get it out.
I chose to give me up.
There's a massive culture around the verbal language.
And just because I don't use my literal voice to communicate, the eyes of society is like I didn't have a voice at all.
So I have to work with people who can support me as well as well as to become my voice.
So I'm able to be relevant in today's society.
So in school, in the work and institutions, work with many different performers <unk>
And his voice becomes my voice and identity.
They help me be <unk>
And their voices have value and weight.
Ironically, by asking for <unk> their voices, I am able to maintain a temporary form of value something like taking a loan to a very high interest rate.
If I don't go through this practice, I feel that I could be able to do it in the forget and not have any kind of social value.
So with sound like my new art environment, <unk> in the world of music.
And I was surprised to see the similarities between music and <unk>
For example, a musical note can't be capture and completely express on paper.
And the same can be told by a concept in <unk>
The two are very expensive, and they are highly <unk> which means subtle changes can affect the whole meaning of signals as the sounds.
I'd like to share with you a metaphor for the piano, so you understand better how the <unk> works.
So imagine a piano.
The <unk> divide into a lot of different <unk>
If you take a different <unk> for each finger as you touch the piano, as the facial expression, the body of body, the speed, the shape of your hand, and so on the piano, the English is a linear language, as if you get it just one key at a time.
However, <unk> is more like a <unk> you need the 10 fingers in the way to express a concept of clear or an idea in <unk>
If you just change the <unk> it would create a completely different meaning.
Same thing with music in terms of tone and <unk> volume.
In <unk> by using these different parameters, you can express different ideas.
For example, the signal is <unk> in that."
This is the signal <unk> in that."
I'm looking at you.
<unk> <unk>
Oh, I was <unk>
Let's get them around.
What are you <unk>
Ah, <unk>
So I started thinking, and if I look at the <unk> through the glasses of music?
If I had to create a sign and put it over and over again, it could be like a piece of visual music.
For example, this is the <unk> sign of the sun and you get it.
This is <unk>
If you <unk> and <unk> the speed, visually looks like a piece of music.
All day.
I feel that the same can be said to <unk> the <unk>
"All the <unk>
This is all night, in this drawing.
And this led me to think about three different kinds of <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>  <unk> <unk>
I feel that the third one has more <unk> than the other two.
This represents how time expresses time to <unk> and how the distance to your body can express changes in time.
For example, one <unk> is a hand, two <unk> is two hands, the present is closer and in front of the body, the future is in front of the body and the past is on the back.
So the first example is <unk> a lot of time."
And then <unk> <unk> <unk> and the last one, which is my favorite, with a very romantic idea, and dramatic and dramatic idea at the time -- again."
<unk> <unk> is a musical term with a specific rate of four times by <unk>
However, when I see the word <unk> <unk> I think automatically in <unk> same time."
Look at <unk> right hand, <unk> hand.
We have the <unk> through the head and the chest.
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> I'm going to show you a way of hand called <unk> <unk>
Can you do with me?
All the hands in the top.
Now we're going to do it as much in your head as a chest, kind of like <unk> <unk> or <unk> same time."
Yeah, very well.
That means <unk> in the international system.
The international system, as a note, is a visual tool to help communicate in all cultures and language languages all over the world.
The second one I'd like to show you is this one. Please do it again.
And now this.
It means <unk> in the <unk>
Now, the third. Please get it back again.
And again.
It's <unk> in the <unk>
We're going to do three together.
<unk> <unk> and <unk>
Good job.
Look at how three signs are very similar. They all occur in your head and the chest but they get so much together.
It's amazing to see how the <unk> is alive and wealthy as the music.
However, today, we live in a very <unk> world.
And just because the <unk> has no <unk> automatically doesn't have social value.
We need to start questioning what defines social value and allow the <unk> to develop its own value, without sounds.
And this could be a step to make a more <unk> society.
And maybe people understand that you don't have to be deaf to learn how to learn how to learn to learn music.
The <unk> is a rich Choir and I'd like you to have the same experience.
I'd like to give you to open your ears, open your eyes, to participate in our culture and experience from our visual language.
And you never know, you can even fall in love with us.
Thank you.
<unk> <unk> Hey, that's me.
And as a child, my parents said, "Can you take it all -- but then you have to <unk>
Power involves responsibility.
But my imagination took me to all these wonderful places, where everything was possible.
So I grew up in a bubble of innocence or a bubble of ignorance I have to say, because adults lied to us to protect ourselves from the horrible truth.
When I get older, I learned that the adults also <unk> and that they are not very good at cleaning the others.
Time spent now I'm an adult and I teach citizen and invention in the <unk> School of Hong Kong.
You don't have to wait a lot for my students to walk through the beach <unk> with lots of crap.
So as good citizens, we clean the <unk> and no, not drinking alcohol, and if it is, I don't know it.
It's sad to say, but now more than 80 percent of the oceans contain plastic.
It's kind of creepy.
And in the last decades, we've been coming out with these big ships and networks, to collect those pieces of plastic to study under the microscope, and the <unk> and <unk> this information on a map.
But it lasts an eternity and it's very expensive and it's also very risky to use those huge boats there.
So with my students, with ages six to 15 years, we dream to invent a better way.
We've transformed our tiny classroom in Hong Kong in a workshop.
We began to build this <unk> <unk> job so that the very <unk> children can also participate.
And I will tell you, the kids who are carrying electric tools feel cool and safe.
Not exactly.
Let's go back to plastic.
We collect plastic and reduce it the size we find it in the ocean, which is very small, because of its <unk>
That's what we do.
I leave it to my students.
My job is to try to take the best ideas in every single child and try to engage them in something that we hope will work.
We decided instead of collecting pieces of plastic, just <unk> information.
Through the use of a robot, we take a picture of this <unk> the kids are getting a lot with the robots.
Then we started what we call "a <unk>
We're so fast at creating prototypes that we end up before lunch.
And we turned out light bulbs and camera cameras out there and <unk> on a floating robot that will move slowly by the water and the plastic that we have there, and this is the picture captured by the robot.
We see the pieces of plastic floating slowly through the sensor while the computer on board processing this image and measure the size of every single <unk> to get a measure of the amount of plastic in water.
<unk> this invention step in a website to inventors called <unk> with the hope that someone would get it even more.
The great thing about this project is that students saw a local problem, and <unk> are trying to answer it right away.
I'm able to investigate my <unk> problem, but my students in Hong Kong are very good children.
You see the news news, <unk> the Internet, and they <unk> with this one.
A child, maybe less than 10 years ago, cleaning up a oil oil -- only using the hands, in <unk> the largest largest rainforest in the world in Bangladesh.
They were really surprised because this is the water that <unk> is the water that they <unk> the water in which the water is coming in.
You can also see that the water is brown the mud and oil are also brown and the oil are also brown and when everything is <unk> it's very hard to see what's in the water.
But there is a simple technology called <unk> which allows you to look at the water.
So we built a first prototype of a <unk> that can take away through all kinds of substances that produce different <unk> which can help to identify what's in the water.
We had this prototype with a sensor and we send it to Bangladesh.
The great thing about this project is that beyond solving a local problem, or looking at a local problem, my students used their empathy and their sense of creativity to help other children.
I can actually investigate a problem with <unk> I was forced to do a second experiment, and I wanted to go a little bit further, maybe to address a harder problem, and also closer to me.
I'm half Japanese and French and perhaps remember, in 2011, there was a devastating earthquake in Japan.
It was so violent that it started several giant waves called <unk> and those <unk> were destroyed several cities on the coast of Japan.
Over 14,000 people died in a second.
It also gives the nuclear energy plant in Fukushima, a nuclear power plant to the water.
And today, according to the reports an average of 300 tons are still leaking from the nuclear plant in the Pacific Ocean.
Today, the entire Pacific Pacific has traces of pollution by <unk>
If we go to the west coast, we can measure the radiation of <unk> everywhere.
But if you look at the map, it seems that most of the radiation disappeared from the Japanese coast of the Japanese coast, and the majority of the time, it has a safe aspect of blue.
Well, the reality is a bit more complicated than that.
I've gone back to <unk> every year from the crash and research and independently with other scientists, the land, the river, and this time we wanted to bring the children.
Of course not the <unk> the parents didn't get it.
But every night I went to the center of <unk> here you see the use of different <unk>
It might seem not to be really seriously, but I know they did because they're going to have to live with the <unk> all their lives.
Along with them we discussed the data that we have to do that day and talk about what we were going to do later, the strategies, the <unk> and so on.
And to do this, we create a <unk> map of the region around the nuclear power plant.
We created the map of <unk> <unk> contraceptives to represent real-time data from <unk> and <unk> water to simulate the rain.
So with this we could notice that the radioactive powder is <unk> from the top of the mountain towards the system and <unk> in the ocean.
It was a <unk> <unk>
But based on this we organized a civil expedition -- the closest to the nuclear power to date.
We are approaching about 1.5 miles of the power station, and with the fishermen from the fishermen in the area we were collecting beneath the sea bed with a sample of sediment that we invented and we built it.
Here we see a <unk> we've gone from a local problem to a remote problem, to a global problem.
And it's been very exciting to work on these different scales, also with open-source technologies and very simple technologies.
But at the same time, it's been increasingly frustrating because we've only been starting to measure the damage we've done.
We haven't even started trying to solve problems.
I wonder if we should take the leap and try to invent better ways to do all of these things.
So the classroom became a little bit so small so we found an industrial facility in Hong Kong and we turned it into the largest space dedicated to social and environmental impact.
It's at the center of Hong Kong and it's a place where we can work with wood, chemistry -- a little bit of biology, basically, you can actually build it almost out there.
It's also a place where adults and kids can play together.
It's a place where the dreams of children can actually become the help of adults, and where adults can be children again.
<unk> <unk> <unk>
<unk> <unk> We asked ourselves things like, we can invent the future of mobility with <unk> energy.
For example.
Or can we help in mobility as advanced population, transforming their standard wheels in new vehicles.
The plastic, the oil and the <unk> are <unk> terrible, but the worst legacy we can leave our children are the lies.
We can't afford to protect the children of the horrible truth because we need their imagination to invent the solutions.
So, scientists, scientists <unk> we have to prepare for the next generation to be worried about the environment and people, and so that I can actually do something about it.
Thank you.
Two <unk> <unk> two different cultures in the opposite design.
One is made out of thousands of steel, the other one of a silk silk.
One of them is synthetic the other organic one.
One is imposes on the environment, the other thing we thought about.
One is designed by nature, the other for it.
Michelangelo said that when he looked at the <unk> <unk> he saw a figure that struggle to be free.
The <unk> was the only tool of Michelangelo.
But living beings are not <unk>
They grow.
And in the smallest units of life, the cells, we carry all the information required for every cell to work and to <unk>
The tools also have consequences.
At least since the Industrial Revolution, the world of design has been dominated by manufacturing and mass production.
The assembly lines have dictated a world that is made out of parts, <unk> the imagination of designers and architects trained to think their objects as <unk> of <unk> parts with different functions.
But you don't find <unk> material in nature.
Think of human skin, for example.
Our facial skins are thin with <unk> <unk>
The skin of the back are denser with little <unk>
You act primarily like filter it mainly as a barrier, and yet, it's the same <unk> there's no parts, there's no <unk>
It's a system that moves its functionality through the variation of <unk>
Here's a divided screen that represents my view of the world -- the double personality of every designer and architect in the moment between the <unk> and the gene between the <unk> and the organism, between the assembly and the organism, between the assembly and the organism, between the assembly and Charles Darwin.
These two visions of the world, my left hemisphere and the law, and analytics and chair are shown in the two screens after me.
My work, in the simplest level, tries to bring these two visions of the world, away from the assembly and approaching growth.
You probably ask, why now?
Why couldn't it be possible about 10 or even five years?
We live in a very special moment in history, a rare moment, where we have four disciplines that give designers access to the tools we had never had access to before.
And at the intersection of these four fields, my team and I create.
Please meet the minds and the hands of my students.
We're designing objects, products, structures and tools through scales, large-scale <unk> like this robotic arm with a 24 meters in diameter of a <unk> basis that one day is not far far distant to print <unk> and graphics made out of the <unk> <unk>
So here we have <unk> an archetype of the ancient Arab architecture, and he has created a screen where every apex is <unk> only to model the form of light and heat through it.
In our next project, we explore the possibility to create a layer and a <unk> -- this was for a <unk> fashion <unk> <unk> -- it's like a second skin made from one piece of piece, <unk> in it it was a single piece of piece, <unk> around the waist.
Along with a remote printing collaborator we print this layer and <unk> 3D <unk> and I'll show you more objects like that.
This helmet combine rigid materials and <unk> in the resolution of 20 <unk>
This is the resolution of a human hair.
It's also the resolution of a <unk> scanner too.
That designers have access to this high-resolution analytical and the instruments of <unk> it allows to design products that are <unk> not only the form of our bodies, but also the physiological structure of our tissues.
We also designed a practical chair a chair to the comfortable structural chair and also it absorbs sound.
The Carter professor came back to nature to <unk> and by designing this <unk> pattern becomes <unk>
It <unk> this surface of 44 different properties that vary in <unk> <unk> and color, <unk> to the pressure points in the human body.
Their surface, as in nature, change its functionality is not by addition to addition to other material addition to the addition of other material or another <unk> it's continually <unk>
But it's nature <unk>
There are no parts in nature?
I was not raised in a Jewish Jewish home, but when I was a young man, my grandmother told me stories about the Bible <unk> and one of them was left and define a lot of what I care about.
Like she <unk> "In the third day of <unk> God send her Earth to grow a <unk> tree <unk>
For that first <unk> tree, there would be no difference between trunk, and then the leaves and <unk>
The whole tree was a <unk>
Instead, the land made trees grow trees with branches, <unk> water and flowers.
The land created a world made in place.
I often ask myself, "What would the design be if objects were made of a single minister.
<unk> a better state of <unk>
So we look for the material -- the kind of material of the tree material with fruit and fruit and we found it.
The second most abundant <unk> on the planet is called <unk> and about 100 million tons of tons of tons of tons of tons of tons of tons of tons of tons of tons of tons of tons of tons of tons of tons of tons of tons of tons of tons of tons of tons of tons of tons of tons of tons of tons of tons of tons
We think that if we can tune their properties, we could generate <unk> structures in one piece.
So that's what we did.
We call it legal <unk>  We wanted a lot of <unk> <unk> <unk> and we produced <unk>
<unk> chemical concentrations have been able to get a wide range of properties, from dark, hard and <unk> to light, soft and transparent.
To print the large-scale structures -- this is built a system with multiple <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
The robot can vary the properties of the stuff on the march and create these structures made of one three three feet long, long, 100 percent.
When the pieces are ready, it stops it to dry it to find a natural form to contact with the air.
So why do we keep designing with <unk>
The air bubbles that were a byproduct of printing were used to contain call: <unk> that first appeared on the planet three billion years ago, as we heard yesterday.
Together with our collaborators at Harvard and MIT, <unk> bacteria designed to capture rapidly carbon from the atmosphere and turn it into sugar.
For the first time, we have been able to generate structures that make their transition without <unk> <unk> and if <unk> even more, to windows.
A <unk> tree <unk>
Working with a ancient material, one of the first forms of life on the planet, with abundant water, and with a little synthetic biology, we've transformed a structure out of shrimp <unk> in an architecture that acts as a tree.
And here is the best part: for objects designed for <unk> <unk> <unk> life and placed on the ground, they'll help grow a tree.
The match for our next exploration using the same design principles was the solar system.
We're looking for a chance to make clothes to keep the life for the <unk>
To do that, we need to master bacteria and control their flow.
Just like the <unk> table we did our own <unk> new forms of life created <unk> made <unk> and <unk> <unk>
I like to think about synthetic biology as the liquid <unk> only that instead of <unk> metals -- <unk> new biological basic channels.
This field is called <unk>
We put our own 3D channels to control the flow of these <unk> <unk> <unk>
In our first piece of clothing, <unk> two <unk>
The first is <unk>
She lives in our oceans and in the tanks of fresh water.
And the second E. <unk> the bacteria that <unk> in the human heart.
One turns the light turns into sugar, the other blood takes sugar and produces some useful biofuels.
But these two things: don't interact in nature.
In fact, it's never been <unk>
They're here, designed for the first time, to have a relationship in a piece of clothes.
Think about it as evolution, not by natural selection, but evolution by design.
In order to contain these relationships, we have created a single channel that looks like the digestive tract that will help you to <unk> these bacteria and to make it <unk> their way.
So we started to grow those channels in the human body, <unk> the properties of material as it is <unk>
If we wanted more <unk> <unk> channels <unk>
This system is <unk> when you stretch from one end to another, takes 60 meters.
This is half the length of a football field, 10 times more than our very weak gut itself.
And here it is, as <unk> at TED, our first <unk> <unk> channels with life inside the clothes.
Thank you.
Mary <unk> said, "We are average creatures of fashion -- only half a <unk>
What if design would provide the other <unk>
And if we could create structures that increase matter <unk>
And if we could create personal <unk> that we <unk> our skin -- <unk> the neural tissue and <unk> our <unk>
Think of this as a way of edit biology.
I call this the material.
So you always have to go back to nature.
At now, you know a 3D printer in layers.
You also know that nature doesn't do that way.
<unk> <unk> with <unk>
This cocoon of <unk> for example, creates highly sophisticated architecture -- a home within which they <unk>
The manufacturing is not <unk> it's about this <unk> level.
It makes it through the combination of two materials, but two proteins in different <unk>
One acts as a structure, the other is the glue or the matrix, by putting those fibers between them.
And this happens across scales.
The silk worm first goes on in the environment, creates a structure of tension, and then it starts to <unk> a cocoon of compression.
The tension and the <unk> the two forces of life, manifest themselves in a single material.
In order to understand how this complex process works, we attach a small magnet into the head of a silk worm to <unk>
We put it into a box with magnetic sensors, and that allowed us to create this cloud of points in three dimensions and visualizing the complex architecture of the privatization of silk worm architecture.
And yet, when you put the silk worm on a flat patch -- not within a box, we realized that you would go on a plane and still <unk> <unk>
So we started designing different places, different <unk> and we've discovered that the way, the composition, the structure of the <unk> is directly transmitted by the environment.
It's often <unk> the silk worms to death inside their <unk> its silk <unk> and it's used in the <unk> industry.
We saw that designing these models we could shape <unk> <unk> silk <unk>
It was <unk> and we could create these things.
So we climbed this process into the architectural scale.
We had a robot <unk> making silk, and we put it into our site.
We knew that silk worms were <unk> towards the darker and <unk> and we used a solar diagram to reveal the distribution of light and heat into our structure.
And then we create holes or <unk> to block the rays of light and the heat, as the silk worms about the structure.
We were prepared to get the <unk>
<unk> <unk> silk worms to a online silk farm.
And after <unk> four weeks, they were prepared to <unk> with us.
We put them carefully on the lower edge of the <unk> and as we were <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and life starts again, like us, but much, much later.
<unk> Fuller said that tension is the big integrity, and he was right.
By <unk> biological silk about silk <unk> <unk> give all this pavilion its integrity.
And in a little more than two or three weeks, <unk> worms is <unk> <unk> miles.
In a curious symmetry, this is also the length of the silk.
<unk> after the <unk> produce 1.5 million eggs.
This could be used for 250 extra <unk> in the future.
So here are the two visions of the world.
A <unk> silk is using a robotic arm, the other full <unk>
If the last frontier of design is to provide life and the buildings around us, to form a ecology of two materials, designers should bring these two visions of the world.
Which leads us back to the beginning.
So here is a new era of design, a new era of creation, which brings us from a design inspired in nature to a nature inspired by design, that demands us, for the first time, that we make it in charge of nature.
Thank you.
Thank you very much. Thank you.
Raise your hand if you've ever asked, "What do you want to be <unk>
If you had to remember what age they had when they were asked for the first time this?
You can <unk> with your fingers.
Three. Five. Three. Five. Five.
Now, raise your hand if the question is, "What do you want to be <unk>
It has caused them some kind of anxiety.
Any anxiety.
I am somebody who could never answer the question, "What do you want to be <unk>
The problem was not that I had no interest, but I had <unk>
In school, I liked the English and the <unk> and the art and spent websites and he went on to play the guitar in a punk band, called <unk> <unk>
Maybe you've heard about us.
And in general, I like to try and persist in anyway, because we have spent a lot of time and energy and sometimes money in this field.
But over time, this feeling of <unk> this feeling of, this is no longer a challenge, it comes to <unk>
And I have to let it off.
But then I went through something else, something completely different, and I get involved in it, and I will let me absorb and feel <unk> I've found <unk> and then again this point where I start to <unk>
And finally, I want to let it off.
But then I'd like to discover something new and different, and I'd like to go into that.
This pattern caused me a lot of anxiety, for two reasons.
The first one was because I wasn't sure how I was going to turn this into a career.
I thought I had to choose one thing, to deny all my other passions, and I would say to <unk>
Another reason that caused me as much anxiety was a little bit more personal.
I was worried that there was something wrong about this, and something bad at me for not <unk>
I was worried about being afraid of engagement, or whether I was contributing or to <unk> or to my own success.
If you can relate my story and these feelings, I would like to ask you something I'd like to ask for me then.
<unk> themselves, where they learned to assign the meaning of evil or abnormal to do things.
I'm going to tell you where they did it, they learned it from culture.
You ask first, "What do you want to be <unk>
When we have about five years.
And the truth is that no one cares about what they were at that age.
It's considered a naive question to cause nice answers in children like, <unk> <unk> or <unk> <unk> or I want to be <unk>
<unk> the <unk> <unk> here.
This question is done over and over again, as we grow in various ways, <unk> <unk> to high school students, you ask them to pick up in college.
And at some point, "What do you want to be <unk>
It happens to be the cute exercise of before the dream.
Why?
So if this question inspires kids to dream with what they might be, it's not inspired to dream with everything that might be.
In fact, it does just the opposite, because when somebody asks you what you want to be, you can't respond to 20 different things, even though you might well be <unk> and say, "Oh, what cute, but you can't be <unk> but you can't be <unk> and <unk>
You have to <unk>
This is Dr. Bob <unk>  And he's a <unk> <unk> and <unk>
And this <unk> <unk> editor turned into <unk> <unk> a teacher and a creative player.
But most kids don't hear about people like this.
All you hear is they're going to have to choose.
But it's more than that.
The notion of life is very <unk> in our culture.
It's this idea of fate or the real <unk> the idea that each one of us has something to go to do during your time on this land, and you have to figure out what that thing is, and to dedicate your life to it.
But if you're somebody who is not connected to this way?
What if there are a lot of different issues that wake up their curiosity and lots of different things that want to do?
There's no place for someone like one in that framework.
And so you can feel alone.
You can feel that it doesn't have a goal.
And feeling that there's something wrong with you.
There's nothing wrong with you.
You're a <unk>
A <unk> is someone with many interests and creative activities.
It's a <unk> so I say.
It could help in three <unk> and potential <unk> potential and <unk>
You can also use some of the other terms, you can use the same idea, like <unk> <unk>
So during the time of the Renaissance, the ideal was the ideal who was good at multiple disciplines.
Barbara <unk> refers to us as <unk>
<unk> any term you like or <unk> your own one.
It seems like a kind of adapt to a community, we can't agree with a single identity.
It's easy to see <unk> like limitation or <unk> you have to beat.
But what I've learned about talking about people and writing about these ideas on my website, is that there are huge strengths in this way.
Here are three superpowers <unk>
One, the synthesis of ideas.
I mean, the combination of two or more fields and creation of something new in <unk>
<unk> <unk> and Rachel <unk> <unk> their shared interests in fact, visualization of data, and travel, and design and design, when we found <unk>
<unk> is a company that creates Google <unk>
<unk> and Rachel came up with this unique idea of his <unk> mixture of skills and experiences.
The innovation happens at intersections.
That's where new ideas.
And the <unk> with all their background, can access a lot of these points of <unk>
The second superpower, <unk> is learning fast.
When we are <unk> we are going to do that.
We looked at everything we can have in our hands.
We are used to be <unk> for having been many times in the past, and this means that we have less fear of testing new things and out of our comfort.
A lot of skills are <unk> to other disciplines and we bring all of what we have learned to every new area that we have, so we rarely start from zero.
<unk> <unk> is a <unk> full-time <unk> and <unk> <unk>
As a child pianist -- an incredible capacity to develop muscle memory.
Now, she's the fastest <unk>
Before I was a writer, <unk> was <unk>
He had to learn the most thin sales mechanics when they started their own, and this skill helps to write <unk> for the editors.
<unk> is a loss of time to go to what you can do to you even if at the end of the end of it.
It's possible to apply that knowledge in a completely different field, in a way that you could not have <unk>
The third superpower, <unk> is adaptability. I mean, the ability to turn into anything you need in a <unk> situation.
<unk> <unk> is sometimes director of videos, other pages of web pages -- sometimes a Kickstarter, sometimes teacher, and sometimes, apparently, James <unk>
It's valuable because a good job.
He's even more valuable because it can take diverse <unk> depending on the needs of their clients.
<unk> magazine, Company defines adaptability as the most important ability for development, to thrive in the 21st century.
The economic world changes so rapidly and <unk> which are the individuals and organizations that can be <unk> to meet the needs of the market, which is really <unk>
<unk> of ideas, fast and <unk> three skills where <unk> are very <unk> and three skills that you might lose if they're <unk> to reduce their goals.
As a society, we have a great interest in encouraging <unk> to be themselves.
We have complex problems, it's right right now, and we need creative thinkers to address them.
Let's say they are, in your heart, <unk>
<unk> on the belly of knowing because they wanted to be <unk> <unk>
Don't worry, there's nothing wrong with you either.
In fact, some of the best teams make up a doctor and a <unk> <unk>
<unk> can dive in depth and put in ideas, and the <unk> offers a breadth of knowledge to the project.
It's a beautiful relationship.
But all of us should design lives and careers that we are connected.
And unfortunately, to the <unk> in large part of them that they just become more like their fellow <unk>
So once I said this, if there's one thing that you take from this talk, I hope it will be this: <unk> with the inner footprint, whatever it is.
If you are a heart specialist then, you know, <unk> all the media.
That's where you will give the best of it.
But for the <unk> in the room, including those who have just been aware of being one of them in the last 12 minutes,  I say, <unk> with your many passions.
Keep his curiosity for those <unk> <unk>
<unk> intersections.
We <unk> our internal wired it leads to a more authentic life and happy life.
And perhaps most important, we have the world <unk>
Thank you.
In the year we went to a woman named <unk> he took them to a psychiatric <unk>
<unk> <unk> and I couldn't remember even the most basic details of his life.
His doctor was called <unk>
<unk> I didn't know how to help <unk> but <unk> for her until he passed away in <unk>
After his death, <unk> did a <unk> and they found weird plates and <unk> in the <unk> brain of a guy who had never seen before.
The most amazing thing.
If you would have been alive today, we couldn't give her more aid than <unk> he gave him <unk> years ago.
<unk> was Dr. <unk> Alzheimer's disease.
And <unk> <unk> the first patient in receiving a diagnosis that we now call Alzheimer's disease.
From <unk> medicine has advanced a lot.
They've discovered antibiotics and vaccines to protect us from the <unk> many treatments for cancer, antiretroviral HIV, <unk> for <unk> and much more.
But gradually has been progress in treatment disease.
I'm part of a team of scientists who work to find a cure for Alzheimer's for more than a decade.
So I think about this all the time.
Alzheimer's now affects 40 million around the world.
But by 2050, it will affect 150 million affecting 150 million of you.
If you expect to live up to 85 years or more, the possibility of Alzheimer's will be almost one of two.
In other words, there is the chance that you have to spend your years <unk> or Alzheimer's disease or helping care of a friend or want to be dear to Alzheimer's disease.
In the U.S., Alzheimer's disease costs 200 billion dollars every year.
One of five dollars in medical care spends in Alzheimer's disease.
Today it's the most expensive disease and its costs -- an increase in five times in the year 2050, as the generation of the <unk> <unk>
It may surprise you, but Alzheimer's is one of the major doctors and social challenges of our generation.
But it's been relatively little to <unk>
Today, one of the top 10 causes of death from all over the world, Alzheimer's is the only one that cannot cure or even slow its development.
We understand less than Alzheimer's other disease than we have to do more time and money on the research itself.
The U.S. government spends 10 times more every year in cancer research in Alzheimer's disease in spite of the fact that it costs us more Alzheimer's and causes a similar number of deaths like cancer.
The lack of resources is due to one cause more fundamental cause <unk>
Because this is what time people know, but all the world <unk> Alzheimer's is a disease, and we can <unk>
For most of the last few years, years, all of us, even scientists, Alzheimer's Alzheimer's with aging.
We think it will be <unk> in an inevitable part of aging.
But you just have to look at a picture of a healthy brain compared to a Alzheimer's patient to see the real physical damage caused by this disease.
In addition to unleash a severe memory loss and abilities that damage to the brain caused by significantly significantly life expectancy and it's always deadly.
Remember, Dr. Alzheimer's found plates and <unk> strangers in the brain of <unk> a century.
For almost a century, we didn't know much about this.
Today we know that they're made of proteins.
You can think of a protein molecule like a piece of paper that folds up as a origami.
There are places in the paper that are <unk>
And when it folds well, these <unk> points end up inside.
But sometimes things go wrong, and some points are <unk> on the outside.
This makes the molecules of protein <unk> each other, forming groups that can form big plates and <unk>
That's what we see in patients with Alzheimer's.
We've spent the last 10 years at Cambridge University trying to understand how this <unk> works.
There are a lot of steps, and the identification of what step step step is, like <unk> a bomb.
<unk> a wire could do anything.
<unk> others can make the bomb <unk>
You have to find the right step that you can do, and then create a drug that does it.
Until recently, in its most part, they've reduced the wires and waited for the best.
But now there is a diverse group of people, doctors, biologists, and physicists and physical <unk> engineers and mathematician.
And together, we've managed to identify a critical step in the process -- now it's testing a new kind of pharmaceuticals that they can block specifically this step to stop the disease.
I'll show you some of our latest results.
Nobody outside our lab has seen it yet.
Let's look at some videos of what happened when we test these drugs in <unk>
These are the healthy worms -- and you can see they move with normal.
These worms on the other hand, have protein molecules that stick to each other within them, like in humans with Alzheimer's disease.
And you can see that they're clearly sick.
But by giving our new drugs to these worms at an early stage, then we see that <unk> and they live a normal life.
This is just a very positive outcome, but research as this shows that Alzheimer's disease is a disease that we can understand and cure.
After <unk> years of wait, there's real hope of what can be achieved in the next 10 or 20 years.
But in order to get that hope, from defeat Alzheimer's disease, we need help.
It's not about scientists like me, it's about you.
We have to imagine that Alzheimer's disease is a disease and that if we do it, we can <unk>
In the case of other diseases, patients and their families have <unk> more research and <unk> pressure over governments, industry industry, about scientists and <unk>
That was essential to advance the HIV treatment in the late '80s.
Today we see that same unit to defeat cancer.
But Alzheimer's patients often can't talk about themselves.
And their families, the hidden victims of their loved ones day and night, are often too <unk> to go out and advocate for change.
So it really depends on you.
Alzheimer's is not most of a genetic disease.
Everybody with a brain runs the risk.
Today, there are 40 million patients like <unk> that can't create the change they need for themselves.
They were talking about them, and help demand a cure.
Thank you.
I was going to take this article in the New York Times, in the New York Times, in January of this year.
To fall in love with someone, do this.
The article about a psychological study designed to create romantic love in the lab, and my own experience by testing myself one night last summer.
So the procedure is quite simple: Two strangers are <unk> to get over to get 36 questions, and then they both look at the eyes without talking about four minutes.
Here's a couple of questions of example.
Number <unk> If you could wake up tomorrow with a quality or skill, which would be?
Number <unk> When was the last time you would get to another person?
And <unk>
We <unk> these are increasingly personal <unk>
Number <unk> <unk> really <unk> me to your partner what you like about it, or her, I know very honest about this time, and I gave things that you have just ever met.
When I came across this study a few years ago, I really struck me the attention, the gadget of two of the participants had married six months later, and invited all of the lab to the <unk>
So, it was <unk> about this process of making romantic love, but of course, it was also <unk>
And when I had the chance to test this study, with somebody who I knew not particularly very well, I didn't expect them to do.
But we were <unk> and   And I thought it was a good story, so I send it to the column that I send it to the Love Love for a few months later.
That was published in January, and now it's already <unk> so I guess some of you probably ask you, they still still still follow together.
And the reason I think the challenge is because I've done this question over and over the last seven months.
And this question is just what I want to talk about today.
But let's go back to that.
A week before the paper was published in a very nervous.
I had been working in a romantic book in the last few years, so I had been able to write about my experience in romantic love on my blog.
But a blog blog can come to a few hundred views like a lot, and those were usually just from my Facebook friends and imagined that my article in the New York Times would have a few thousand views.
And that came up with a relatively new relationship burden on a relatively new relationship.
But as I had had no idea.
The article was printed on a Friday night, and I went on Saturday, this was happening in my blog.
And the Sunday had already called the Show Show and Good <unk> <unk>
In a month, the article got over eight million pages, and I was, for saying something, little prepared for this kind of attention.
One thing is to foster trust writing with them about their own <unk> experiences, but another thing is to discover that the loving life of an international news has been an international news --  and that people around the world are really interested in the state of your new relationship.
And when people called it or writing, what they did every day for weeks, always, they were going to first the same question: follow together?
In fact, when I was preparing this talk, I did a quick search on my email over my email with the phrase, <unk> <unk>
And several messages appeared immediately.
They were from students and journalists and strangers -- like this one.
I was interviewed on radio and <unk>
But even I gave a talk, and a woman attempted to stage, "Hey <unk> where is your <unk>
And I immediately <unk>
I understand this is part of the deal.
If you write about your relationship in an international newspaper. you should expect people to feel comfortable asking about it.
But I wasn't prepared for the <unk>
The 36 questions seemed to have <unk> their own.
In fact, the New York Times published a <unk> article for San <unk> who included the readers experiences by testing the study in them with different degrees of success.
So, my first impulse to all this attention was to be very <unk> with my own relationship.
I said not to every request that we both did a public emergence together.
We had the TV interviews, and <unk> the pictures of the photos of us two.
I think I was afraid of becoming a fear of becoming a <unk> <unk> process, a range for which I didn't feel at all.
And I understand that people didn't want to know if the study worked, they wanted to know whether they really wanted to know whether I was able to produce <unk> love, not just an adventure, but real love, love.
But this was a question that I didn't feel like to answer.
My relationship was just a few months and I felt, most of all, that people asked the wrong question.
How do you know if you were doing it or not, and also <unk>
If the answer was no, I would make the experience of making these 36 questions less interesting?
Dr. Arthur <unk> wrote first about these questions in this same study in 1997. And there the goal of the researcher was not to produce romantic love.
Instead of that, I was looking at interpersonal approach, between college students, using what they <unk> called <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
Sounds romantic, right?
But the study worked.
The participants were feeling more close after doing a number of historical studies, they also used scientific protocol -- <unk> as a quick way to create trust and interaction between strangers.
They've been used between members of the police and the community. And they used them to be used among people from the <unk>
The original version of the story, which I tried last summer, who combine personal questions with four minutes of visual contact, was cited in this paper, but unfortunately never published it.
A few months ago, I was giving a talk in a little liberal arts university, and then a student came up to me and said to me and said to me, <unk> the study and didn't work.
He seemed <unk> for it.
And I said, Do you want to say that you get out of the person with whom you did it.
Well he did a program.
I think she just wants us to be friends.
And I said, but they became better friends?
<unk> they were able to get better people after testing the research.
The <unk>
So, <unk> I said.
However, I don't think that was the answer that he was looking for.
In fact, I don't think it's the answer that none of you are looking for when it comes to love.
I came across the study for the first time when I was 29 and was going through a really difficult separation here.
I had had that relationship since I had 20, what was virtually all my adulthood, and he was my first real love, and I had no idea how or I could live without it.
So I was a way in science.
I did so much of what I was able to find on the science of romantic love, and hoped that it could sort of <unk> the heart.
I don't know if I realized this at the time I thought I just went for the book I was writing but in retrospect, it seems really <unk>
I thought that if I was excited about romantic love, I would never have to feel as bad and used to me then.
And all this knowledge has been useful in one way or another way.
I'm more patient with love. I'm more <unk>
I have more confidence in demand what I'm after.
But I can also see me more clearly, and I can realize that what I'm looking for is sometimes more than reasonably happy to me.
What I'm looking for about love is an instrument not just to be <unk> today and to be <unk> tomorrow, but to continue to be able to be able to be able to stand up with the person I love.
It may be that this is the guarantee that people wondered when they wanted to know whether we were still together.
The story that the media told you about 36 questions is that there may be a shortcut to <unk>
There may be a way to be able to mitigate some of the risk -- and this is a very difficult story, because in love to make us feel <unk> but it's also terrifying.
But I think when it comes to love, we are very willing to accept the short version of history.
The story of the story that you ask is, still together?
And his content with a <unk> <unk>
So more than a question, <unk> that we make more difficult questions, questions like, how do you decide who deserves your love and who not?
How are you going to stay in love when things are <unk> and how to know when to cut and <unk>
How do you live with uncertainty which inevitably leads to one another, or even more, how do you live in doubt your <unk>
I don't necessarily know the answers to these questions, but I think they're a good start to have a <unk> conversation, what it means to love somebody.
So, if you want the short version of my relationship, it's <unk> a year ago, a known and I apply a study designed to create romantic love, we still follow together, and I'm very <unk>
But in love is not the same thing to remain <unk>
<unk> is the easy part.
So at the end of my article <unk> The love was not happened.
<unk> in love -- because we take the choice to be.
And I <unk> a little bit to read it now, not because it's not true, but because at the time, I had no thought of everything that was supposed to happen.
I didn't think of a number of times we would have both that make that decision, and how much times will it have to keep doing that choice without knowing before he would always pick up or not.
I want it to be enough to have done and responded 36 questions, to have chosen to love someone so generous, kind and fun and expressed that choice in the largest newspaper in the United States.
But what I've done, instead, is to turn my relationship to the kind of myth that I don't really believe it.
And what I <unk> and what maybe spend my life looking for is that that myth is true.
I want the happy to implicit in the title of my paper, which is, by the way, the only part of the article I didn't really wrote.
But what I have in change is a chance to choose to love someone, and the hope that he also love, and it's frightening, but that's the deal with love.
Thank you.
I was raised by a couple of <unk> in full mountain and I kind of got a <unk>
It really affected me to New York City a while.  And something that really affected me later on.
I'm going to start with when I was eight years old.
I took a box of wood, and <unk> a dollar, a dollar, a pen and a fork in it somewhere in Colorado.
And I thought that some strange <unk> or some aliens would find this box about 500 years later and <unk> how our species <unk> ideas, for example, how we eat <unk>
I had no idea.
Anyway, it has grace because here I am, 30 years later, and I'm still doing boxes.
At a moment since I was in <unk> <unk> like to go from tour and get <unk> and all those things, I was doing a girl for my mother.
And I took a dictionary and I took all the pages and I made a kind of <unk> <unk> to the style I covered it -- I covered them up to them and a bee kept <unk>
Well, my mother has fear of bees and it is <unk> to them, so I added more diverse onto the canvas, thinking it could be <unk>
Instead, what happens is, in some way it seemed that it grew up as a size, as if it was going to take the text with a <unk>
So I did, I built more boxes.
This time, I started adding some electronic elements, and we were very strange that I was finding out the street, and all I could find, because I was looking for things all my life, trying to <unk> and tell stories about these objects.
So I started drawing around the objects, and I realized that God I can draw in space.
I can flow from drawing like it is around a <unk> <unk>
And I took out the objects and I created my own helices of specimens <unk>
First of all, I think you can get a idea.
Then I made some insects and strangers.
It was very fun to draw on the layers of <unk>
And it was great, because I started building exhibitions and those things, and I was making some money, and I was making my girlfriend for dinner, for example, going to <unk>
It was great man.
At some point, I was interested in the human way, sculptures of natural size with drawings of human beings inside layers.
It was great, except for one thing: I <unk>
I didn't know what to do, because the animations.
And I was going to bed every night thinking about it.
So I tried to use glass.
I started drawing on the glass layers, similar to the drawing on a window, and then on another window, and another window, and I had all these windows together and so they formed a three-dimensional composition there.
And this really works, and so I could stop using the <unk>
So I did this for years, and my work with something very big, which I call <unk>
For the <unk> I was inspired by the <unk> in "The <unk> <unk> <unk> which is a painting at the <unk> Museum in Spain.
Do you know it.
Well, it's a fantastic picture.
They say it's a bit ahead of your time.
Well, the <unk> <unk> this piece.
It weighs 11 pounds.
<unk> feet long.
It's twice a little face, so it's 10 feet long.
It's kind of weird.
Well, that's the source of blood.
On the left is Jesus and <unk>
There's a cave where all these creatures with heads of animals travel between two worlds.
They go out of the world of <unk> this <unk> mesh of the <unk> where they <unk>
So here is where the creatures with heads of animals are heading at <unk> lists for suicide lists in the ocean.
The ocean is comprised of thousands of elements.
This is a god tied down to a <unk>
Billy Graham is in the <unk> The <unk> -- the <unk> platform of the <unk> <unk> the refuge of Osama bin Laden, there are all kinds of weird things that you can find if you look very well at the ocean.
Anyway, also a kind of <unk>
It's coming out of the ocean, and it spits out oil in a hand while from the other hand as the other hand comes clouds.
Their hands are like <unk> and it seems like a <unk> to keep the Earth and the cosmos in equilibrium.
So it's a aspect of <unk>
It's a little story.
That's the hand that we <unk>
And then, when you go to the other hand, it has a <unk> like a steam peak.
It also has a <unk> tail.
Anyway, their tail turned out fire to <unk> on a <unk>
I don't know why it happened to it.
Things that go by, you know.
Their tail ends up in a <unk> <unk> made from terrorist cards from 1986.
They've been <unk>
They were done in the 1980s, as if they were baseball cards from the terrorists.
It brings me to my last project.  This brings me to my last project.
I'm in the middle of two <unk> One is called <unk>
This is a six-year-old project to make 100 of these human beings.
Each one is a archive of our culture, through media and material to be <unk> dictionaries or familiar.
But each one is acting as a kind of archive in the way of being human, and they travel in groups of 20, four or 12 at the time.
They're like cells, they come together, they get together.
And you can walk between them. I'm getting a few years.
Each one is basically a <unk> of microscope that weighs 1.3 pounds of a human in the inside.
This has a little cave in the chest.
That's the <unk> he's the chest, you can get it down the ticket.
I'm going to show you for the rest of the body -- there's a waterfall you get out of your chest, and you cover the penis or <unk> or whatever you have, a kind of <unk> thing.
This is a quick attempt for these works because I can't afford it for a long time.
We have layers, you can see them.
This is a body game.
This has two heads, and it's communicating between the two.
There are a few pills they come out and come into the head of this strange statue there.
There's a little forest scene inside the <unk> <unk>
You can <unk>
Anyway, this talk is about these <unk> like the boxes we live in.
We're in a box, the solar system is a box.
This brings me to my last box.
It's a brick box. It's called <unk> <unk>
In this box there is a physicist, a neuroscientist, a neuroscientist, a painter, a writer, a writer, a writer, a <unk> a museum, a school arm, which spreads all the content that we do in the world, and a garden.
It was <unk> the box and all the people in it hits each other like particles.
And I think that's how to change the world.
When you <unk> who is and the box that's living in.
And together we came to realize that we're all together in this, that this illusion that we are different, these concepts of the countries, of the borders, it doesn't work.
We're all very facts about the same matter and in the same box.
And if we don't start to exchange those things with sweet things, and we're all going to die very soon.
Thank you very much.
What do they do when they hurt your mind?
They take a <unk>
But so that this pill has effect against pain, first goes through the stomach, the <unk> and other organs.
It will take a pill to be the most effective and <unk> system for any drug that could be effect on the body.
The <unk> though, is that the <unk> any drug is <unk>
And this is a big problem, especially in HIV patients.
When they take <unk> drugs, these serve to decrease the amount of viruses in the blood, and increase the heart of <unk> cells.
But they are also known for their side effects, mostly negative effects -- because in the time it takes to get to the current   <unk> and worse for the time that it takes to get to their destiny, which is where it's more important in HIV.
These are regions of the body like the lymph nodes. the nervous system, the lungs, where the virus is <unk> and it doesn't easily go into the blood stream of patients that are going to be given to regular therapy with antiretroviral drugs.
However, after the treatment, the virus can wake up and infect new cells.
This is the great problem with HIV treatment with the current drugs, which is a treatment for life run by an oral basis.
One day, I sat down and I thought, <unk> to make the treatment directly to the virus, without the risk of <unk> of <unk>
As a scientific scientist in <unk> the answer was in front of me, <unk> of course.
If you use it in <unk> for care of wounds and surgery of diabetes -- can be used for anything else, including the drug <unk>
In fact, we're using laser pulses to open or drill extremely small holes, which open and close to immediately the cells infected with HIV to bring drug drugs.
The best people are saying, "How do we get it?
We sent a small and powerful beam of laser <unk> on the living membrane of HIV while these cells are embedded in a liquid that contains the drug.
The laser goes through the cell, while the cell absorbs the drug in a matter of microseconds.
Before we even counts, the hole is <unk> immediately.
We're testing this technology in which we are testing or <unk> but the goal is to bring this technology to the human body, apply it to the human body.
"How do that happen?
Well, the answer is: through a <unk> device.
With the first head, which is our laser, we're going to do a <unk> at the site of the infection.
The second head, which is a camera, you go to the infection.
Finally, the third head, a <unk> which distributes the drug, it releases it directly into the site of infection, while the laser is used again to keep open cells.
Well, this doesn't look a lot of time.
But one day, if you succeed, this technology can lead to total eradication of HIV in the body.
Yeah. A cure for HIV.
This is the dream of a whole researcher of <unk> in our case, a laser treatment.
Thank you.
In the last decade, I've been studying armed groups that were armed with armed organizations like terrorists, insurgents or <unk>
<unk> what these groups do when they're not <unk>
My goal is to understand better to these agents of violence and study ways of encouraging the transition from violent participation into the violent <unk>
I do work work in the world of politics and in the library.
Understanding these groups are key to solving almost every conflict in course, because the war has changed.
It used to be a dispute between states.
Not anymore.
Now this is a conflict between states and actors did not non-governmental
For example, the <unk> arrangements between 1975 and 2011, <unk> were signed between a state and a non-governmental actor.
So we need to understand these <unk> we need even <unk> or <unk> in any resolution process of financial conflict.
But how do we do it?
We need to know what it motivates these organizations.
We know very well the reasons why they do it, but no one is looking at what they do when they don't survive.
The armed struggle and the policies were not armed with it.
It's all part of the same organization.
We can't understand these groups, not much less <unk> without a global vision.
The armed groups today are complex organizations.
For example, the <unk> <unk> known for its violent <unk> against Israel.
From its creation in the 1980s, <unk> has also established a political party -- a network of social services and a military device.
Similarly, the Palestinian <unk> known for their suicide attacks against Israel, also runs the <unk> of Gaza since 2007.
So these groups do more than just to fire.
They're multitasking around.
We have a complex machinery of communication stations -- radio stations radio channels TV websites and network websites in social networks.
And here you have <unk> magazine in English and published to <unk>
The armed groups also invest in a complex fundraising of funding without <unk> but through business -- for example, companies of construction.
These activities are key.
They allow these groups to increase their strength, increase their funding, to recruit better and build their brand.
The armed groups also do something else, create stronger ties with their population to invest in social services.
They build schools, they run hospitals, they set in professional training programs or <unk> programs.
<unk> offers all these services and more.
The armed groups are also trying to conquer the population offering something that the state didn't have security and protection.
The rise of the Taliban in a Afghanistan owned by war or even the <unk> beginning of <unk> can also be able to look at the efforts of these groups to provide safety.
Unfortunately, in these cases, security has a price high for the population.
But in general, providing social services that means filling a vacuum <unk> a <unk> gap by the government, and allow these groups to strengthen and increase their power.
For example, the election election of 2006 from Palestinian novelists cannot be able to recognize the social work of the group.
It's a really complex scenario even in the West, when we look at the <unk> groups, we just think about the violent side.
But that's not enough to understand the strengths of these groups, strategy or long-term vision.
These groups are <unk>
<unk> because they fill it out of <unk> gaps by government, and they emerge as armed and political groups, participate in the violent struggle and give governance.
And the more complex and the sophisticated ones are these organizations, less we can <unk> it as something else to a state.
How would a group like <unk>
It was part of an territory, and they run all of its function, collect the trash -- they run the <unk> system.
It's a busy group.
Or maybe it's something else, something new and different.
And what is <unk>
The lines.
We live in a world of states, of nations without sunglasses, and the more weak ones are states, like in the Middle East and the current the current Middle East and fill that gap together.
This is important for governments because to counter these groups are going to have to invest more in the dominant tools.
They had that governance vacuum has to be at the center of any sustainable approach.
This is very important to establish and implement the peace.
If we better understand the groups, we will understand better how to incentives to foster violence to violence to not violence.
In this new <unk> between states and actors not <unk> the military power can earn some shift, but not stability.
To get these goals we need long-term investments to fill in that safety of security, to fill that ball of government that allowed these groups to thrive in a principle.
Thank you.
I'm a failure as a woman and a feminist person.
My opinions about gender equality are <unk> but I'm afraid to accept openly the tag of <unk> it would be <unk> for the <unk>
I'm <unk> but quite bad.
And so I was so excited about it as a bad feminist guy.
Or at least, I wrote a paper, and a book called "The <unk> and then in interviews, people began to call me the <unk> <unk>
So what started as a personal joke meant to myself and a <unk> <unk> has become a little bigger.
Let me take a step back.
When I was a young man, especially in my youth and the 20 years, I had strange ideas about the <unk> these women <unk> <unk> with the men and that they would say, sex.
Today, I see how women are being treated in the world and anger, in particular, seems to be a perfectly reasonable response.
But at the time, I was worried about the tone that I was using people in the <unk> that could be feminist that could be a feminist person.
It will be labeled as a feminist was an <unk> a taboo word.
I was <unk> as a woman who doesn't follow the rules, which makes too much, with high self-esteem and dare to believe it's equal or superior to a man.
Nobody wants to be that woman <unk> until it realizes that it's actually that woman and he can't imagine being another person.
Over time, as I went growing up, I started to accept that I was in fact, <unk> and also, proud to be.
For me, certain claims are <unk> women are equal to men.
They would get the same wages for the same work.
We have a right to travel around the world as <unk> <unk> or violence.
We have a right to use it and be accessible to the contraceptives and the services.
We have the right to decide about our bodies, no need for controls or doctrines to <unk>
We have the right to respect.
There's more.
When you talk about the needs of women, you have to have our other <unk>
We're not just women.
We are people with a different body, expression of gender, religion and <unk> social condition, social condition, and much more.
We need to have these differences and how we behave in the same way that matter what we have in common.
Without this kind of <unk> our feminism is nothing.
For me, these truths are <unk> but to be clear: I'm a mess.
I'm full of <unk>
There's a lot of things that make me a bad feminist guy.
I have another confession.
When I drive to work, I hear rap music -- <unk> by volume.
Even though the letter diversion to the women and it offends me deeply, the classic <unk> <unk> of yin yang <unk> is amazing.
<unk> reality with your <unk>
<unk> <unk> <unk> until you get <unk>
Think about it.
<unk> poetry, right?
And I'm completely excited about my musical music.
I firmly believe in the work of man, which is all I don't want to do, <unk>  All of the <unk> <unk> but also killing insects -- the collection of crap.
I don't want to have anything to do with that.
The pink is my favorite color.
<unk> the fashion magazines and the nice thing.
And I can see "The <unk> and the <unk> <unk> and I have erotic erotic stories that make it happen.
Some of my crimes are more <unk>
If a woman wants to adopt the name of his husband, it's his choice, and I am not who to be <unk>
If a woman decides to stay at home to raise their kids, I agreed that choice, too.
The problem is not that it gets economically vulnerable through this very choice, the problem is that our society is <unk> so that the women are economically vulnerable when they <unk>
So let's get this problem.
<unk> the conventional feminism who has ignored or <unk> historically the needs of color, the working and gay workers and <unk> for white, <unk> and high women.
Listen, if that's good feminism -- I'm a very bad feminist guy.
Also the following: <unk> <unk> I feel a lot of pressure.
We have this tendency to put <unk> in a <unk>
We hope it will be extremely nicely.
When we were <unk> the <unk> with a lot of taste from the same <unk> where the <unk>
As I said, I'm a <unk> I think I think of that <unk> before you try to put up there.
<unk> women, particularly the innovative and the leaders of the sector, are afraid of being tagged as <unk>
They are afraid to stand up and say, "Yes, I am <unk> for fear of what it means by fear of not being able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to
Let's take <unk> or like I call them, <unk>
In the last few years, it's a feminist <unk>
In <unk> Music <unk> from 2014, in <unk> <unk> in front of the word <unk> <unk>
It was a <unk> show to see this star of pop embracing openly feminism and making the women and young men who being feminist is something to be proud of.
<unk> the time, the cultural critics started debates -- if we were <unk> it was or not quite a feminist question.
He said, "Well, instead of simply believing the word of an adult woman and <unk>
<unk> perfection from <unk> because we're still fighting for a lot, we want a lot, we need a lot of <unk>
We go beyond the sane criticism and <unk> to <unk> feminism from any woman, <unk> until it's nothing.
We don't need to do that.
evil leadership? Or rather, a more feminism feminism is the point.
But what happens next?
We went to recognize our <unk> to give it the day, go to action and be a little more <unk>
If I hear music, I am creating a demand for artists that would be more happy to deliver a <unk> supply.
These artists will not change their way to talk about women in their songs until they <unk> change to their profit.
It's certainly hard.
Why has his music to be so <unk>
It's hard to choose something better and so easy to justify a worse choice.
But when the bad decisions are justify this makes it more difficult for women to achieve equality, gender equality we all deserve and is our responsibility.
I think of my <unk> three and four years.
These are two girls and <unk> and brilliant, and also too <unk> I want you to grow in a world.
So they are being asked by the strong creatures that they are.
I think of them, all of a sudden, the best option will be <unk> as much easier to do.
We can all make better decisions.
We can change the channel when a television program comes to sexual violence against women like sports <unk> <unk> <unk>
We can change the radio radio when we hear songs that treat women like anything.
We can spend our money to go to the cinema on another part when movies don't deal with women more than as <unk> objects.
We can just stop supporting professional sports and where athletes treat their fellow <unk>
In any case, men, especially white men can say, "No, I'm not going to post on your magazine, engaging in your project, or work with you, until you don't have a number of enough women, so much to participate in making decisions.
I'm not going to work with you until your <unk> or your organization is more <unk> with a wider range of people.
Those of us who are <unk> but <unk> to participate in these kinds of projects, we can also be able to be even more than more like people are <unk> to overcome the barriers to the decision jobs.
Because we're not <unk> <unk> Without these efforts, without making these <unk> our achievements are going to mean very little.
We can make these small acts of bravery and hope that our decisions get to the top, to people in power and movie producers and music, <unk> the <unk> the people who can make great decisions, more courageous, to create a durable and significant change.
We can also say with bravery our as, well, bad, or any <unk>
The last line of my book <unk> <unk> says, <unk> will be a bad feminist to not be in <unk>
This is true because of a lot of reasons, but I tell you, mostly because <unk> my voice was <unk> and feminism helped me <unk>
There was one incident.
I call it incident to address what happened.
And a few kids asked me when I was very young, and I didn't know that kids can do this to a girl.
They treated me as if it was nothing.
I started to believe that it was nothing.
I <unk> my voice, and after all, I didn't care about that I could say something that might matter.
But I was writing.
And I went back to <unk>
I would have a stronger version of myself.
I read the words of those women who could understand a story like mine, and of the women who looked like me and understood what meant living in this world if you have the brown skin.
I read the words of women who showed me that it was nothing.
I learned to write like them, and then I learned how to write like myself.
I found my voice again, and I started to believe that my voice is powerful beyond what you can measure.
Through writing of writing, I also found that if I was a little brave another woman could hear me and see that none of us is nothing that the world tries to tell us that we are.
In one hand, I have the power to achieve anything.
And in the other, I actually put the chances that I'm just a woman.
I'm a <unk> <unk> I'm a good woman, I'm trying to improve my way to think, what I say and what I do, without leaving everything that makes me human.
I hope we can all do the same thing.
I hope that we can all be a bit courageous, when you need such <unk>
Right after Christmas last year, <unk> children in California had <unk> because I visited <unk> or being exposed to someone who had been there.
The virus then went through the border with Canada, <unk> over 100 children in <unk>
One of the things that was <unk> from this outbreak is that the <unk> that can be bad for a child with a <unk> immune system is one of the most easily explorer, diseases in the world.
There is an effective vaccine against this for more than half a century -- but many of the kids involved in the Olympic outbreak -- they hadn't been vaccinated because their parents were afraid of something supposedly <unk> autism.
But a moment, it was not the article that broke the controversial thing about autism and vaccines <unk> and marked by being an <unk> fraud by the British Medical Center.
It doesn't believe most intelligent scientists that vaccines cause autism is a <unk>
I think most of you know, but millions of parents around the world are still <unk> that vaccines will get in danger to their children of having autism.
Why?
Here's why.
This is a graph of the rise of autism in time.
For most of the 20th century, autism was considered a very bizarre disease.
The few psychologists and Hippocrates, who had heard about she believed to develop all his professional life without seeing one case.
For decades, the prevalence estimates were stable just three or four children for every 10,000 <unk>
But then, in the 1990s, the numbers started to <unk>
<unk> of fundraising as <unk> <unk> refer to autism as an epidemic, as if I could <unk> from another child in <unk>
What's going on?
If you're not vaccines, what is it?
If you ask people about the Center for Disease Control what is going on, they tend to be based on phrases like <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> to explain these <unk> numbers.
But that kind of language doesn't <unk> a lot of fears of a young mother who is looking for the face of his son, <unk>
If the diagnostic criteria had to be <unk> why were they so <unk> at the beginning?
Why were the cases of autism so hard to find before the decade of <unk>
Five years ago, I decided to discover the answers to these questions.
I learned that what happened has less to do with slow progress and <unk> of science that with the <unk> of storytelling.
For most of the 20th century, the doctors told you a story about what autism is and how it discovered, but that story turned out to be fake, and the consequences of the same are having a devastating impact on global public health.
There was a second more precise story of autism that had lost and forgotten in the dark corners of the clinical literature.
This second story tells us all about how we got here and where we need to go.
The first story begins with a child psychiatrist Leo <unk> at Johns Hopkins Hospital.
They could fun for hours by waving their hands in front of their faces, but they were trading out of the panic by <unk> as when they didn't put their favorite toy in their usual place without knowing them.
On the basis of the patients treated in their clinic, <unk> <unk> that autism is very rare.
For the 1950s of 1950, as the main authority of the world in the subject, stated that I had seen less than 150 cases of their syndrome while we were <unk> references to the places as far as South Africa.
This is actually no wonder, because the criteria of <unk> for autism diagnosis were very <unk>
For example, <unk> to give that diagnosis to <unk> but now we know that society is very common in autism.
Once it was <unk> that he had become nine in 10 children sent by other doctors to their office for being autistic without giving them a diagnosis of autism.
<unk> was a smart man, but part of his theories wasn't <unk>
You know, autism as a form of <unk> child caused by cold parents, and <unk>
These kids, he said, you've carefully kept in a refrigerator that you don't know.
At the same time, though, <unk> I noticed that some of their young patients had special skills that they cluster together in certain areas like music, math and memory.
One of the kids in their clinic could distinguish between 18 <unk> before I turned the two years.
When his mother put one of his favorite records he properly said, <unk>
But <unk> had a bad opinion of these skills, claiming things like the children were just simply <unk> what they had heard their parents were desperate to win their <unk>
As a result, autism became a source of shame for families, and two generations of autistic children were sent to institutions for their own good, becoming invisible to the world in general.
Amazingly, it wasn't until the 1970s, the researchers started to test the theory of <unk> that autism was weird.
<unk> <unk> cognitive psychologist in London, thought that the theory of mothers <unk> was quite stupid.
She and his husband John were warm and <unk> and they had a profound autistic daughter called <unk>
<unk> and John knew how hard it was to raise a girl as a Susie, <unk> no special education, no special education, no access to other resources without a diagnosis.
To stand up to the National Health Service they needed more resources for autistic children, and their families, <unk> and his colleague Judith mostly decided to do something that should have done 30 years before.
They did a study of autism prevalence in the general population.
It was a suburb in London called <unk> to try to find the autistic children in the community.
What they saw was clear that the <unk> model was too limited, because the reality of autism was much more <unk> and diverse ones.
Some kids couldn't speak at all, while others were <unk> in their fascination by astrophysics, or in the <unk> of the <unk>
In another way, these children didn't fit in the <unk> and <unk> as <unk> said, and they saw a lot of them, much more than the <unk> model of <unk> would be predicting it.
At first, they were lost to try and make sense of their data.
How did no one ever realized about these children before?
But then <unk> found a reference to an article that was published in German in <unk> the next year to the article of <unk> and then he <unk> buried under the ashes of a terrible time that nobody wanted to remember.
<unk> knew about this article of competition, but avoided <unk> <unk> in his own work.
There was not even a translation of English, but luckily, the husband of <unk> was German, he was German, and he <unk> him for her.
The document is offering an alternative story of autism.
His author was a man named Hans <unk> who ran a integrated clinic with a school in Vienna in the 1930s.
<unk> ideas for teaching children with learning differences were <unk> even for contemporary standards.
The morning in his clinic started with music exercises with music, and the kids still follow their game games by late.
Instead of blaming the parents of causing autism, Asperger's described described as disability <unk> of life that required <unk> forms of support and <unk> spaces during the course of all life.
Instead of treating the kids in their clinic as patients, Asperger's called them their little teachers, and he started to help in the development of methods that were especially good for them.
And lo and saw the autism as a diverse continuum that included a surprising variety of gifts, and disability.
He believed that autism and autistic traits were common and always have been, seeing aspects of this continuum in <unk> <unk> as the <unk> social scientist, and Professor <unk>
He was beyond even to say, for success in science and art, a little bit of autism is essential.
<unk> and Judith found that <unk> was wrong where autism was <unk> as well as the parents were <unk>
Over the next few years, they worked in silence with the American Association of <unk> to expand the criteria of diagnostic that reflect the diversity of what they called <unk> <unk>
By the end of the 1980s and early '90s, their changes in <unk> by <unk> the limited model of <unk> per broad <unk>
These changes were not fell in a sleeping bag.
<unk> when I <unk> and Judith worked with the <unk> to reform these <unk> people around the world see an autistic adult for the first time.
Before he came out <unk> <unk> in 1988, just a little circle, <unk> by experts knew what the autism, but after the <unk> performance of <unk> <unk> like <unk> <unk> and <unk> recognition and <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk>
At the same time, the first easy clinical trials were introduced to diagnose autism.
I didn't have to have a connection with that little circle of experts to get a diagnosis for her son.
The combination of <unk> <unk> the changes in the criteria and the introduction of these tests created a network, a perfect storm of the awareness of autism.
